# Reality Bender

You are a spellcaster whose only limitation is your own imagination.

## Starting Equipment

This class grants you no additional starting equipment.

## Reality Bender Spellcasting Path

2025-05-28: copied from DC20 Core Rules Beta 0.9.5

Combat Training: None

Spell List: You choose 1 school of magic. This is your Bonded School. When you learn a new Spell, you can choose any Spell from your Bonded School. You bond to more schools as you level up, as shown in the Reality Bender Class Table.

Cantrips Know: The number of Cantrips you know increases as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Reality Bender Class Table. Cantrips are Spells with the Cantrip Spell Tag.

Spells Known: The number of Spells you know increases as shown in the Spells Known column of the Reality Bender Class Table. These can be Spells with or without the Cantrip Spell Tag.

Mana Points: Your maximum number of Mana Points increases as shown in the Mana Points column of the Wizard Class Table.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus.

This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require, even if the spell normally consumes the material components.

When you cast spells, this body part glows, shedding dim light in a 5ft radius. You may choose the color of the glow when you choose the body part.

## Casting Spells

Spells that you cast from your bonded schools have their attributes changed:

-   If the spell has a range greater than Touch or Self, its casting range is changed to your Cast Range
-   Spells that have a duration longer than Instantaneous or 1 round also have their duration changed to your Spell Duration
-   If the spell’s center of effect ever becomes further away from you than the Tether Range, then the spell ends automatically. Leaving the plane counts as leaving your Tether Range.

Your Cast Range, Spell Duration, and Tether Range are determined by your level as shown in the class table.

When you cast the spell, you can decide to lower the Cast Range, Spell Duration, and/or Tether Range of the spell.

Your spell effects are temporary, even if the spell explicitly states that it is permanent. Objects and creatures that you create are also temporary. Your spell effects automatically disappear/revert when any of the following happens:

-   You fall asleep, go unconscious, or die
-   The center of the spell effect leaves your tether range
-   The spell’s duration expires
-   You leave the plane

Cantrips from your bonded schools are also bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration.

## Casting Past Your Mana Spend Limit

If the MP you want to spend on a spell is within your Mana Spend Limit, you can safely cast it.

However, as long as you have the MP to cast a spell, you can cast it, regardless of your Mana Spend Limit. To do this, you may dangerously cast a spell.

To dangerously cast a spell, make a Spell Check with a DC equal to 10 plus 3 times the difference between your Mana Spend Limit and the MP spent. Success: you cast the spell. Failure: you don’t cast the spell, but the MP are still spent, and you cannot attempt to cast that spell again until you finish a long rest.

Dangerously Cast DC = 10 + ((Mana Spend Limit – MP spent) \* 3)

You may spend AP to gain ADV on this roll like normal.

## Dispelling Spells

As an action, you may dismiss any ongoing spell that you have cast, even if the spell explicitly stated that it was permanent.

# Reality Observer

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. You gain the following reaction:

**Reality Observer**  
Trigger: You see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools  
Reaction: You learn the spell. You must finish a long rest before you are able to first cast the new spell.

# Bond Affinity

You gain affinity for spells in your bonded schools, manipulating them to your will. You gain 2 Bond Affinity options from the list below. You learn more as you level up, as shown in the class table. You can only apply 1 Bond Affinity option to a spell you cast. You can only apply Bond Affinity options to spells in your bonded schools. MP spent on Bond Affinity options counts against your Mana Spend Limit.

-   Powerful: 1 MP. Increase healing, damage, or temporary hp of the spell b 1.
-   Reuse: 1 MP. The next time you cast this spell, it costs 2 MP less to cast, minimum 0.
-   Quick: 1 MP. Ignore the Multiple Check Penalty for Spell Checks for this spell cast.
-   Reactive: 2 MP. Cast this spell as a reaction, even if you didn’t declare a hold action.  
    Trigger: Anything.  
    Reaction: Cast this spell.
-   Hasty: 2 MP. Cast this spell as an action, if the spell’s cast time is 1 minute.
-   Capital: 1 MP. Increase your Mana Spend Limit by 3 for this spell cast.
-   Animating: 1 MP. Cast this spell without requiring it to be sustained.
-   Focused: 1 MP. Add your spellcasting ability modifier to the spellcasting ability modifier used by this spell cast.
-   Reaching: 1 MP. Increase this spell’s cast range by your Cast Range.
-   Remote: 1 MP. Increase this spell’s tether range by your Tether Range.
-   Lasting: 1 MP. Increase this spell’s spell duration by your Spell Duration.
-   Enduring: 3 MP. This spell doesn’t automatically disappear due to you becoming asleep, unconscious, or dead.
-   Ashes: 0 MP. When this spell would automatically disappear, it instead lingers for 1 minute, then disappears.

# Attribute Limit Change

Your Attribute Limit is replaced with the following table:

| PC Level | Attribute Limit |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1        | +2              |
| 3        | +3              |
| 5        | +4              |
| 7        | +5              |
| 10       | +6              |
| 15       | +7              |
| 17       | +8              |
| 20       | +9              |

# Bending Trick

You know a spell so well you can cast it with ease. Choose a spell you know. It becomes a Bending Trick for you.

When you cast a Bending Trick, you can apply an additional Bond Affinity option to it. Additionally, the Bending Trick costs 1 MP less to cast, minimum 0.

Whenever you level up, you can upgrade an additional spell into a Bending Trick, using the same rules. You may instead upgrade an existing Bending Trick again instead of choosing a new one, using the same rules.

# Reality Studier

You can more easily absorb information about spells that you see.

You may spend 1 minute studying an ongoing spell effect to make a Spell Check. The DC is equal to 20 plus the spell’s MP cost minus your Mana Spend Limit. Success: you figure out how to cast the spell and can cast the new spell after a long rest. Failure: you don’t figure out the spell, but may try to study it again immediately.

Reality Studier DC = 20 + spell’s MP cost – Mana Spend Limit

# Spell Warp

You can change ongoing spells. When you spend AP to dismiss a spell you cast, you may cast another spell you know for free. The new spell must target the same target(s) as the old spell, and the MP cost of the new spell must be equal to or less than the MP cost of the old spell.

# Recasting

You can keep your spells going longer. You gain the following reaction:

Trigger: One of your spells ends.  
Reaction: You recast the spell on the same target(s), using the same Bond Affinity option(s), spending any necessary MP.

# Reality Command

You gain command of your spells more easily. You may choose a new Bending Trick spell at the start of every month, not just when you level up.

# Bending Styles

At level 3, you choose a Bending Style.

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

### Chaos Buildup

At level 3, you start losing control of your abilities. You gain chaos points at an alarming rate, that builds up overtime, with no maximum value. As you level up, the rate increases.

| Level | Chaos Buildup Rate |
|-------|--------------------|
| 3     | 1/day              |
| 5     | 1/hour             |
| 7     | 1/minute           |
| 11    | 1/round            |
| 15    | 10/round           |

Additionally, whenever you or a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell from your bonded schools, you gain chaos points equal to 5 times that spell’s casted level.

You don’t gain chaos points from this feature while unconscious.

### Chaos Release

At level 3, you can let out your chaotic urges. Whenever you gain chaos points, you may use your reaction to cast a spell you know from your bonded schools.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Chaotic: 0 Spell Points. Spend chaos points for this spell cast instead of spell points. Touch this spell cast with your chaos, also touching creatures effected by this spell cast with your chaos.

You don’t gain chaos points from casting a Chaotic spell.

### Chaos Spread

At level 3, you can’t contain your chaos as it spreads.

When a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell or makes an attack, that spell or attack is also touched by your chaos. A spell that is touched by your chaos causes everything it targets or in its area of effect to also be touched by your chaos. An attack that is touched by your chaos causes its target to also be touched by your chaos, if it hits.

A creature and/or object remains touched by your chaos until:

-   Its chaos duration expires. The chaos duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   It leaves your Tether Range or is no longer on the same plane as you.
-   It uses its action to make a Wisdom ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer touched by your chaos.
-   Your chaos points are reduced to 0 or below.

### Chaos Burn

At level 3, your chaos starts undoing reality. Whenever you gain chaos points, you and things touched by your chaos take force damage, spread evenly amongst all targets. The amount of force damage is equal to your chaos points minus your max spell points, minimum of 0.

### Chaos Modifier

At level 3, your chaos effects your ability to cast effective spells. While you have chaos points, your spellcasting ability modifier is changed to your chaos points divided by 5, rounded up.

### Chaotic Luck

At level 5, outcomes are randomly changed in unexpected ways. Whenever a d20 is rolled, and you have chaos points, if it is rolled by you or an effect or creature that is touched by your chaos, its value is warped. If the result is odd, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to it. If the result is even, you subtract your spell casting ability modifier from it. The result may go above 20 or below 0.

### Origin Shifting

At level 7, the points of origin shift around you in unnatural ways. The origin point of spells and attacks touched by your chaos shift in your shifting direction. Your shifting direction gets set to your current facing direction whenever you cast a Chaotic spell. Origin points continually shift in this direction by an amount equal to your chaos points divided by 10, rounded up to the nearest 5.

When a creature touched by your chaos moves on their turn, they first teleport in your shifting direction, then move from there.

### Lag

At level 11, time starts moving at random speeds. At the start of its turn, a creature touched by your chaos must make a Constitution ability check, with a DC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. On a failure, it doesn’t get to use its action this turn. On a success, nothing happens. If it beats the DC by 5 or more, it gets to take 2 actions this turn.

### Unstable

At level 15, spells become unpredictable. When a spell is cast, if it is touched by your chaos, it has all numbers in its stats and description increased by your spellcasting ability modifier.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Area Modulation

At level 3, you gain affinity for area of effect spells. As a bonus action, you may target an existing area of effect spell in your bonded schools, and increase its radius (or diameter) up to an amount depending on your level, as shown in the following chart. Alternatively, you can decrease its radius (or diameter).

|    | Effect Radius Increase | Effect Diameter Increase |
|----|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3  | 5ft                    | 10ft                     |
| 5  | 10ft                   | 20ft                     |
| 7  | 20ft                   | 40ft                     |
| 11 | 50ft                   | 100ft                    |
| 15 | 100ft                  | 200ft                    |

The target spell must be within your Cast Range. The radius can’t exceed the Tether Range of the spell, or go below 0. If the radius gets reduced to 0, the spell ends.

You may use this feature on an area of effect spell that you did not cast, as long as it is in your bonded schools. If the spell doesn’t have a Tether Range, you use your Tether Range for determining the max radius you can expand it to.

### Area Permanence

At level 5, you learn how to make your spells stable long-term.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Permanent: 0 Spell Points. Increase your Tether Range and/or Spell Duration up to infinity for this spell cast, if it has an area of effect. Double the Spell Point cost and casting time for this spell cast.

Permanent spells cost double the spell points to cast, and take twice as long to cast. If the cast time is less than 1 minute, the cast time is increased to 1 minute. If a Permanent spell is centered on yourself, another creature, or an object, it is instead centered on a point in space.

You cannot use your action to dismiss one of your Permanent spells. Instead, you may spend 1 minute and a number of spell points equal to 5 times the spell’s casted level to dismiss it. You cannot use this feature to dismiss Permanent spells you did not cast.

You may not move a Permanent spell after casting it, even if the spell specifically states that you can.

Permanent spells don’t require concentration. Permanent spells do not dissipate automatically when you leave the plane, fall asleep, go unconscious, or die.

Permanent spells are resistant to being countered and dispelled. If a creature attempts to counter it or dispel it, they must make a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. On a success, they counter or dispel the spell, provided the other conditions are met. On a failure, the Permanent spell still stands.

You may use your Area Modulation feature on a Permanent spell that you cast, but you must spend 5 Spell Points to do so.

### Home Sweet Home

At level 5, you can begin to call your area your home. Each of your Permanent spells contributes to the combined area called your Permanent Area. Whenever you finish a short rest in your Permanent Area, you regain all expended Spell Points.

### Area Fixation

At level 7, other area of effect spells have no effect in your Permanent Area, unless that other spell is also Permanent, or you allow that other spell to effect your Permanent Area.

### Area Manipulation

At level 11, you become adept at manipulating areas. When you cast a spell with the Permanent Bond Affinity option, you may choose an additional Bond Affinity option to apply to it. If you are standing in your Permanent Area, you may choose an additional Bond Affinity to apply to it again.

### Area Admin

At level 15, you gain advanced control over who can access your areas.

As an action, you may choose a creature that is within your Cast Range and outside your Permanent Area to mark as Banned. At the start of a Banned creature’s turn, if it’s inside your Permanent Area, that creature takes up to 10d10 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced 5ft toward the closest square not in your Permanent Area. This effect also happens the first time the creature enters your Permanent Area on its turn. If a Banned creature finds itself inside your Permanent Area due to you casting a spell on its location, its Banned mark is removed.

As an action, you may choose a creature that is within your Cast Range and inside your Permanent Area to mark as Penned. At the start of a Penned creature’s turn, if it’s not inside your Permanent Area, that creature takes up to 10d10 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced 5ft toward the closest square in your Permanent Area. This effect also happens the first time the creature exits your Permanent Area on its turn. If a Penned creature finds itself outside your Permanent Area due to one of your spells being dispelled, its Penned mark is removed.

As an action, you may remove a Banned or Penned mark from a creature.

Each mark is permanent, and you may mark an infinite number of creatures. If you attempt to mark an already-marked creature, the new mark replaces the old mark.

If a creature would take damage from this feature, you may instead reduce that damage to any amount, minimum 0. You may choose the maximum damage a creature can take when you mark them, up to 10d10.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be. You believe reality is broken, and certain schools of magic are to blame.

### Bond Disdain

At level 3, you can disrupt others who are casting spells in your bonded schools. Whenever you or another creature casts a spell, you may apply one Bond Disdain option that you learned to it:

-   Costly: Double the amount of spell slots and/or spell points spent to cast this spell. If the caster can’t pay the cost, the spell fails, still spending any slots and/or points they already spent.
-   Close: Half this spell’s cast range.
-   Tethered: Add a Tether Range to this spell cast equal to its caster’s walk speed, or if it already has a Tether Range, half it.
-   Short: Half this spell’s duration, if its duration is longer than 1 round. If the duration is 1 round, the spell ends at the end of the turn instead.
-   Unfocused: Half the spellcaster’s spellcasting ability modifier for this spell cast, rounded up.
-   Weak: Half any and all die rolls the spell caster rolls for this spell cast, rounded up.
-   Thought Consuming: This spell cast requires concentration, if it doesn’t already.
-   Ephemeral: This spell cast’s effects are temporary, even if explicitly stated to be permanent. This spell cast automatically dissipates when the caster falls asleep, goes unconscious, or dies.
-   Bumped: This spell cast costs an action, if it usually costs a bonus action. If the caster has no actions left, the spell fails, still spending any slots and/or points already spent.
-   Slow: This spell cast takes twice as long to cast, if the cast time is 1 minute or more.
-   Small: Half this spell cast’s radius and/or diameter, if it has an area of effect.
-   Exclusive: Reduce the number of targets this spell cast can target by 1, minimum 0, if this spell can target creatures and/or objects.
-   Downcast: Reduce this spell cast’s casted level by 1, still spending the same amount of slots and/or points, if it was upcast.

You learn a Bond Disdain option at level 3, and may learn a new one at levels 5, 7, 11, and 15. You may not unlearn Bond Disdain options, and you may not replace a Bond Disdain option when you learn a new one.

Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range for you to use this feature. You may apply a Bond Disdain option to a spell even if it already has a Bond Affinity and/or Bond Disdain option applied to it.

If a casted spell is a Bending Trick for you, you may apply an additional Bond Disdain option to it for each time that you chose it as a Bending Trick.

When you apply a Bond Disdain option to a spell that you cast, you may reduce the Spell Point cost of that spell by 5 Spell Points for each Bond Disdain option that you applied to it.

### Easy Dismissal

At level 3, you have disdain for even your own spells. You may dismiss a spell that you cast as a free action instead of an action.

### Peace of Mind

At level 3, you enjoy the feeling of not being around magic. While there is no magical effect of any spell from your Bonded Schools within your Tether Range, you regain 1 Spell Point per minute, increased to 1 Spell Point per round at level 11.

### Halt

At level 5, you learn how to stop reality from breaking. As an action, you can dismiss any ongoing spell effect from your bonded schools even if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect. The spell effect must be within your Cast Range.

### Prevention

At level 7, you learn how to prevent reality from being broken. As a reaction, you can counter any spell from your bonded schools. Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

### Vindication

At level 11, you learn how to absorb spells. When you use Halt or Prevention on a spell, you gain spell points equal to 5 times the effected spell’s level. You may only use this feature on spells you did not cast.

### Restoration

At level 11, you learn how to undo spells. You may spend 1 minute and 20 Spell Points to undo the effects of any spell from your bonded schools, even if the effect is explicitly stated to be permanent. The effects of the spell must be within your Cast Range and must have been cast no longer ago than your Spell Duration.

### Perfection

At level 15, you can stop imperfections from forming. You may spend 1 minute and 10 Spell Points to create an anti-spell field at any point within your Cast Range. The anti-spell field has a radius up to your Cast Range and a duration equal to your Spell Duration, and is bound by your Tether Range.

The anti-spell field causes any spell from your bonded schools that is cast in it or that overlaps with it to fail. Existing spells from your bonded schools that overlap with it are dismissed.

You may use your Vindication feature on spells dismissed and/or prevented by your anti-spell fields.

You may have any number of anti-spell fields active at a time. Your anti-spell fields don’t automatically dissipate when you fall asleep, go unconscious, or die.

As an action, you may dismiss an anti-spell field that is within your Cast Range.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Affinity Assist

At level 3, you gain the ability to help others bend reality. When another creature casts a spell from your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to add one of your Bond Affinity options to it. You can do this even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it by someone else. You may not apply a Bond Affinity option that has already been applied with your Spell Sharing feature.

Either the casting creature or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

If the casted spell is a Bending Trick for you, you may apply an additional Bond Affinity option to it for each time you chose it as a Bending Trick.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Bent: 0 Spell Points. Modify this spell cast’s attributes to your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration.

### Spell Sharing

At level 5, you can give someone else a piece of your power.

You can spend 1 minute to designate another willing creature as a vessel of your power. You must be able to see the creature and they must be within your Cast Range for the whole duration. The creature is now one of your vessels. You can have any number of vessels active at the same time.

As an action, you can share a spell you know from your bonded schools with a vessel in your Cast Range. The vessel gains the ability to cast the shared spell, expending your spell points when they do.

When you share a spell, you may choose a Bond Affinity option to apply to the spell whenever the vessel casts it. You can choose the same Bond Affinity option for multiple shared spells.

While a vessel has a spell, you cannot cast that spell or share it. You can share multiple spells with the same vessel.

A shared spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration, but the ranges use the vessel’s position. A shared spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack modifiers, if applicable. If a shared spell requires concentration, it uses the concentration of the vessel. Every other reference to “you” or “self” in the shared spell refers to the vessel. A vessel gains the benefits of your spellcasting focus when casting a shared spell. If the vessel has a body part similar to your spellcasting focus body part, it glows your spell casting glow color when they cast a spell.

Being a vessel isn’t forever. A creature automatically stops being a vessel if any of the following happens:

-   The vessel duration for the vessel expires. A vessel’s vessel duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   The vessel becomes outside your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   The vessel dies or ceases to exist.
-   The vessel willingly decides to stop being a vessel.
-   You use an action to make them no longer a vessel.

When a vessel stops being a vessel, all spells you shared with them automatically return to you.

As an action, you may refresh a vessel’s vessel duration, if the vessel is within your Cast Range. Additionally, whenever you share a spell with a vessel, that vessel’s vessel duration is automatically refreshed.

As an action, you may take back any number of spells from a vessel, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

As an action, you may revoke a vessel’s vessel status.

### Vessel Casting

At level 7, your vessels become conduits for your power. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Proxied: 10 Spell Points. Cast this spell from a vessel, using their position for this spell cast’s Cast Range and Tether Range.

You may choose a vessel for a Proxied spell, even if they are outside your Cast Range.

### Vessel Network

At level 7, you can see from your vessels’ points of view. As a bonus action, you may sense the world through one of your vessel’s point of view. This lasts until you end it as a free action.

Any position that is within Tether Range of a vessel is considered to be within Tether Range of you.

You may use your Reality Observer and Affinity Assist features on spells that a vessel sees. Additionally, you may use your Reality Studier feature on an ongoing spell that a vessel sees if you and that vessel both study it for 1 minute.

### Worship

At level 11, your power grows the more your name is said.

At the start of a vessel’s turn, they may say your name, granting you 1 spell point.

Additionally, your maximum Spell Points is increased by the number of vessels you have.

### Enhanced Spell Sharing

At level 11, your Spell Sharing feature is enhanced.

-   Shared spells are no longer restricted from you when you share them. You can now share a single spell with multiple vessels, and you can now cast it yourself while it is shared.
-   You may refresh the vessel duration of any vessel that is within your Tether Range.
-   Vessels within your Cast Range continuously have their vessel duration refreshed automatically.
-   Each time a vessel casts a spell that you shared with them, their vessel duration is refreshed.
-   You can use your action to dismiss any shared spell that one of your vessels had casted.

### Evangelization

At level 11, your vessels can evangelize.

You may spend 1 hour to designate a willing vessel as a prime vessel. You must be able to see the vessel and they must be within your Cast Range for the whole duration. That vessel then becomes a prime vessel.

A prime vessel has the ability to use your Spell Sharing feature to

-   Designate other creatures as vessels of yours
-   Share spells with other vessels. The spells they share must have already been shared with them.
-   Revoke shared spells from other vessels
-   Revoke vessel status from other vessels

As an action, you may telepathically communicate a message to a prime vessel. This doesn’t enable the prime vessel to communicate back to you.

Being a prime vessel is forever, with a few exceptions. A prime vessel automatically stops being a vessel if any of the following happens:

-   The prime vessel dies or ceases to exist.
-   The prime vessel willingly decides to stop being a prime vessel.
-   You use an action to make them no longer a prime vessel.

As an action, you may revoke a prime vessel’s vessel state, making them either a regular vessel or just another creature.

### Unity

At level 15, you can unify your vessels in casting a spell. Whenever you cast a spell from your bonded schools, each of your vessels that you choose may use their reaction to cast the same spell you cast at the same level, with the same Bond Affinity option(s). You and your vessels may choose different targets for the spells.

The spell costs the normal amount of Spell Points for you, but it only costs that amount divided by 10, rounded up, for each vessel that casts it.

A vessel can join in the casting of the spell even if they don’t know the spell and that spell has not been shared with them.

### Ascension

At level 20, your vessels are permanent. Vessels outside your Tether Range or in a different plane do not automatically stop being vessels. Vessels no longer have a vessel duration, and remain vessels indefinitely until they willingly stop being a vessel or until you use your action to revoke their vessel status.

## Self-Shaper

You are a self-made person, literally. You modified your being and can modify it to your liking.

### Shape Self

At level 3, you can modify yourself daily. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may make a permanent change to yourself:

-   Appearance. You may change part of your appearance. Ex: the colors of your eyes, skin, hair/fur, racial markers, etc; your height, weight; facial hair, hair coverage, hairiness, facial shape; etc. This appearance change does not have any mechanical effect.
-   Vulnerability. Gain vulnerability to a damage type by losing vulnerability to a damage type your already have.
-   Resistance. Gain resistance to a damage type by losing resistance to a damage type you already have.
-   Immunity. Gain immunity to a damage type by losing immunity to a damage type you already have.
-   Absorption. Gain absorption to a damage type by losing absorption to a damage type you already have.
-   Skill. Gain proficiency in a skill by losing proficiency in a skill you’re proficient in.
-   Expertise. Gain expertise in a skill you’re proficient in by losing expertise in another skill.
-   Alignment. Change your alignment.
-   Affinity. Switch out a Bond Affinity option you know with another one you don’t know.
-   Ability (Level 5). Increase an ability score by up to your spellcasting ability modifier, by decreasing another ability score by the same amount. This feature allows an ability score to go above 20, but not above 30.
-   Bonded Schools (Level 7). Switch out one of your bonded schools for a different school that you don’t know. You still remember spells from your old bonded school, but can’t cast them.
-   Bending Trick (Level 9). Switch out one of your Bending Trick spells for a new Bending Trick spell with the same upgrades as the old Bending Trick.
-   Race (Level 11). Change part of your race. Gain a feature from a race by losing an existing feature not from that race, if you have one. You may also choose which part of your appearance changes. You must have seen the new race at least once. If you use this option multiple times, you become the new race completely when all the features of your old race are gone.
-   Spell (Level 15). Cast a spell you know from your bonded schools that targets only you. You gain the effects of the spell permanently. The spell must either have a duration longer than Instantaneous and 1 round, or have a range of Self or Touch. The spell costs double the spell points it normally would. If the spell fails, the spell points are still spent, and so is the use of this feature. If the spell succeeds, you can’t cast this spell normally or as part of this feature until you spend a future use of this feature to undo this effect.

What changes are available to you depends on your level.

Using this feature again doesn’t automatically undo previous uses of this feature. However, you may spend a use of this feature to undo the effects of a previous use of this feature.

### Self-Centered

At level 3, you can always include yourself. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Self-Inclusive: 5 Spell Points. Also target yourself with this spell cast if it targets one or more other creatures.

### Center of Attention

At level 5, you learn to harness attention. Whenever a spell that you didn’t cast targets you, you regain 10 Spell Points. Spells that you cast that target you cost 10 Spell Points less to cast.

### Improved Ability Score

At level 7, you find ways to rapidly improve yourself. Increase your spellcasting ability score by 1, maximum 30.

Whenever you level up, you may increase an ability score by 1, maximum 30.

### Quick Self Cast

At level 7, you can quickly protect yourself from any threat. As a reaction, you can cast a spell that targets only you, if that spell normally has a cast time of 1 action or 1 bonus action.

### Selfish

At level 11, you can redirect magic into you. As a reaction, you may change one or more of a spell’s targets to yourself, if it is targeting one or more other creatures. If you do, you may spend 5 spell points to use your Quick Self Cast feature as part of the same reaction.

### Identity

At level 15, you can modify yourself even more easily. Whenever you cast a spell that targets only yourself, it costs half as many spell points, rounded down. You can set any and all die rolls of the spell to any value possible for that die.

Additionally, when you cast a spell as part of your Shape Self feature, that spell costs 50 Spell Points less to cast, minimum 0.

## Luck Bender

Fortune favors you and bends to your will.

### Luck Bend

At level 3, your spells are lucky. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Lucky: 5 Spell Points. Reroll all dice rolls for this spell cast, and then choose which set of rolls to use.

### Lucky

At level 5, luck is on your side. Whenever a d20 is rolled within your Cast Range, you may spend 20 Spell Points to force it to be rerolled, and then the most recent value must be used. Subsequent uses on the same roll cost an extra 20 Spell Points, cumulative. You may use this feature on the same roll a number of times up to your level in this class.

### Happy Go Lucky

At level 7, natural luck comes to your aid. You regain 5 spell points whenever:

-   You or an ally rolls a 20 on a d20 or crits on an attack roll that hits
-   An enemy creature rolls a 1 on a d20 or fumbles on an attack roll that misses

### Good Fortune

At level 11, your spells seem to be more effective. Whenever one of your Bending Tricks would have you roll dice, you may roll an additional die of that type for each time you chose that spell as a Bending Trick.

### Plot Armor

At level 15, no one can hurt you. Whenever you or another creature must make a saving throw, you may spend any number of Spell Points to decrease the DC by 1 per 10 Spell Points spent.

Additionally, whenever you are attacked, you may spend any number of Spell Points to increase your AC by the number of Spell Points spent divided by 5, rounded up, until the start of your next turn.

### Dictation

At level 20, you have mastered fortune. Whenever one or more dice are rolled, but before the outcome is determined, you may spend 100 spell points to set any number of the rolled dice to any value possible for that die.

## Item Infuser

You don’t like casting spells directly, and instead prefer to infuse items with your power, and cast spells through them.

### Infusing

At level 3, you gain the ability to infuse an item with a spell.

You may spend 1 hour or more infusing an item you’re holding with a spell from your bonded schools. The spell costs double the amount of spell points it normally would. Make an ability check in your spellcasting ability. The DC equals the spell’s casted level times 2, plus 10, minus the number of hours you spend infusing it. On a success, the Spell Points are spent, and the item is infused with the spell. On a failure, the Spell Points are still spent, but the item is not infused with the spell.

Once complete, the item can be activated to cast the infused spell. The infused spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration at the time of infusion, but its Cast Range and Tether Range use the item’s position instead of your position. You may instead choose to use a lower value for the Cast Range, Tether Range, and/or Spell Duration. The infused spell always uses the Bond Affinity option applied to it when it was infused.

An infused item has a limited number of charges of a spell. It regains all charges at dawn each day. As you level up, the amount of charges you can infuse into an item also increases, as shown in the following table:

| Level | Charges |
|-------|---------|
| 3     | 1       |
| 5     | 2       |
| 7     | 3       |
| 11    | 4       |
| 15    | 5       |

When you an infuse an item, you may instead choose to infuse a lower number of charges than your level allows.

An item can only be infused with one spell at a time. If you infuse an infused item with another spell, the new spell overwrites the old spell.

Infused items are infused permanently. They don’t lose their infusion when they leave your Tether Range, and they don’t expire after your Spell Duration. You may spend 1 hour to un-infuse a spell from an item.

If the infused spell has range of Self, it targets the active user of the item. If the active user changes to another creature during the spell, the target switches to the new active user. If there is no active user, it targets no one, but does not end the spell early.

If the infused spell requires concentration, activating it a second time ends the spell effect of its previous activations. It uses the “concentration” of the item, and not the concentration of the user.

The holder of the infused item may use an action to dispel any spells cast by the infused item. You may also dispel a spell cast from one of your infused items as if you had cast the spell.

You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Infusable: 10 Spell Points. Lower the DC to infuse this spell by 2 times your max safe casting level.

If an Infusable spell is not infused into an item, the spell fails.

### Instant Refill

At level 3, you can quickly recharge an infused item. Once during your turn, you may choose an infused item within your Cast Range and spend spell points equal to 5 times the infused spell’s level to refill 1 charge.

### Item Upgrading

At level 5, you can upgrade infused items you’ve previously infused. While holding the infused item, you can spend 1 hour and a number of spell points equal to the infused spell’s level to upgrade or downgrade the infused spell’s Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration to be equal to or less than yours. You can also upgrade or downgrade its number of charges. You may also choose to replace the spell’s Bond Affinity option with another Bond Affinity option that you know.

### Item Location

At level 5, you learn how to locate items you infused. If an item is within your Tether Range, or if it was infused or upgraded recently within your Spell Duration, you can automatically sense its exact location.

If you cannot sense its exact location, you can try to sense its direction. As an action, you can make an ability check in your spellcasting ability at advantage. The DC is at your DM’s discretion, preferably 15 or more, depending on how far outside your Tether Range it is, and how long ago past your Spell Duration it was infused or upgraded. On a success, you know in which direction the item is.

### Remote Sense

At level 7, you gain senses from your infused items.

You can sense the surroundings of an infused item. As a bonus action, you may choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You can then sense how many items, walls, creatures, etc. are in its vicinity, and their exact locations, but you can’t sense what kind of thing they are. This sense lasts until the beginning of your next turn. If the infused item is not in that exact location, you don’t sense anything.

### Remote Activation

At level 7, you can remotely activate items you infuse. As an action, you may choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You then activate that item. If you can see or have senses of the infused item’s surroundings, you can choose the targets. Otherwise, the infused item automatically targets the closest valid target or area. If the infused item is not in that exact location, this bonus action fails.

### Auto-Activation

At level 11, you learn how to cause an item to react to a situation. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Reactive: 20 Spell Points. Set a reactive condition for this spell cast, which automatically activates this spell cast’s infused item when met.

If a Reactive spell is not infused into an item, the spell fails.

### Multi-Infusing

At level 15, you learn how to cram more spells into a single item. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Appended: 30 Spell Points. Infuse this spell cast into an infused item without overwriting spells already infused into it.

When an item with multiple infused spells is activated, each spell is activated all in the same turn, in order of infusion, using the same targets, if applicable.

If an Appended spell is not infused into an item, the spell fails.

## Battle Bender

You were made for war, and can bend the tides of battle to your will.

### Weapon Observer

At level 3, you remember every weapon, piece of armor, shield, and piece of equipment you see, as well as their stats.

### Spell Conjuration

At level 3, you can conjure spells into a piece of equipment. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Formed: 15 Spell Points. Conjure this spell cast into a piece of equipment you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

The Formed spell appears as a spectral shape modeled after the piece of equipment you remembered, but has no special effects, and does not cast the spell’s effects when conjured.

The Formed spell has max hit points and AC equal to its casted level.

A Formed spell is very volatile, and dissipates at the end of your turn if:

-   It has 0 hit points or less.
-   It was conjured longer ago than your Spell Duration.
-   It is outside your Tether Range.
-   It hit the ground or another creature and you are not holding it.
-   It got hit by another creature and you are not holding it.
-   You are asleep, unconscious, or dead.
-   You used your action to dismiss it.

A Formed spell does not require concentration to remain formed. You can have multiple Formed spells in existence at once.

### Born to Forge

At level 3, conjuring weapons made of magic comes more naturally to you than casting spells.

Spells you cast without a Formed bond affinity option cost an extra 25 Spell Points to cast.

When you cast a Formed spell, you may choose to spend 1 minute casting it instead, if it normally takes 1 action or 1 bonus action to cast. If you do, the Formed spell’s Spell Point cost is reduced by 5 times your Reality Bender level.

### Weapon Conjuration

At level 3, you can conjure spells into a weapon. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Weapon-Formed: 15 Spell Points. Conjure this spell cast into a weapon you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

A Weapon-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure a Weapon-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen weapon that you remembered, with the same damage roll and properties, but with force damage as the damage type. Its attack modifier ability is your spellcasting ability, and when it hits, it does extra damage equal to the spell’s casted level and procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on the target. If it is ranged, it magically conjures its own ammo, and its max range is your Tether Range. If it is thrown, its max range is your Tether Range.

You have proficiency with your Weapon-Formed spells. Other creatures may also have proficiency with them, if it is in the form of a weapon that they have proficiency with.

### Formed Spell Proc

At level 3, your Formed spells can cast themselves on a target. When a Formed spell procs this feature on a creature, it casts the Formed spell on them. Any to-hit rolls in the spell’s description automatically succeed, and the creature automatically fails any Dexterity saving throws in the spell’s description. The spell may only target the single creature, even if the spell description says otherwise. The spell doesn’t require concentration.

### Arcane Armor

At level 3, you can protect yourself with your magic reserves. Your AC is increased by the number of Spell Points you have divided by 20, rounded up.

### Extra Attack

At level 5, your combat prowess grows. When you take the Attack action, you may make an additional attack.

### Armor Conjuration

At level 5, you learn to protect yourself with your spells. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Armor-Formed: 15 Spell Points. Conjure this spell cast into a piece of armor you remember and don it, if the spell can target one or more creatures, and has a duration longer than Instantaneous and 1 round.

An Armor-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure an Armor-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen piece of armor that you remembered, with the same AC bonus, but no movement or ability penalty. You can choose to conjure it on a willing creature within your Cast Range instead of yourself.

Whenever you don an Armor-Formed spell, it procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on you. The spell lasts while the armor is donned, and ends automatically when the armor is doffed or it dissipates.

You can only wear one Armor-Formed spell at a time. If you don an Armor-Formed spell while already wearing one, the new one replaces the old one, and the old one dissipates. You may wear an Armor-Formed spell over physical armor.

You have proficiency with your Armor-Formed spells. Other creatures may also have proficiency with them, if it is in the form of a piece of armor that they have proficiency with.

### Shield Conjuration

At level 7, you learn how to conjure shields. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Shield-Formed: 15 Spell Points. Conjure this spell cast into a shield you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

A Shield-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure a Shield-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen shield that you remembered, with the same AC bonus.

Whenever you or an ally within melee range of you is targeted by an attack, you may use your reaction to intercept, imposing disadvantage to the attack roll. If the attack misses, your Shield-Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on the attacking creature, if that creature is within your Cast Range.

You have proficiency with your Shield-Formed spells. Other creatures may also have proficiency with them, if it is in the form of a shield that they have proficiency with.

### Instant Repair

At level 7, you learn how to keep your equipment intact. As an action, you may choose any number of your Formed spells within your Cast Range and spend Spell Points equal to 5 times that number to instantly restore their hit points to maximum and refresh their durations.

### Temporary Permanence

At level 11, you work around some limitations of your conjured spells. Formed spells no longer dissipate at the end of your turn due to you not holding them.

### Forced Armor

At level 15, you can force armor onto unwilling creatures. You may attempt to use your Armor Conjuration feature on an unwilling creature, spending Spell Points as normal. That creature makes a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. On a success, your conjuration fails, but you still spend the Spell Points. On a failure, your conjuration succeeds.

### Violent Dismissal

At level 15, you figure out how to exploit the volatile nature of your Formed spells. As an action, you can choose one of your Formed spells and make it explode. All creatures in a radius equal to your Cast Range and with line of sight of the Formed spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take damage equal to the Formed spell’s casted level and the Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on them. On a success, they take half as much damage and suffer no ill effects.

The Formed spell is destroyed immediately when it explodes.

You may target a Formed spell with this feature even if it is outside your Cast Range or Tether Range.

### Rigged Conjuration

At level 15, you can get one last use out of your Formed spells. Whenever one or more of your Formed spells would simply dissipate at the end of your turn, you may instead use your reaction to activate your Violent Dismissal feature on any number of your Formed spells about to dissipate.

You may also activate Violent Dismissal when you dispel one of your Formed spells as an action.

### Last Word

At level 15, you can react to the death around you.

Whenever you or another creature you can see dies, you may use your reaction to activate your Violent Dismissal feature on any number of your Formed spells.

## Far Watcher

You don’t really want to participate in reality, and prefer to watch it unfold instead.

### Bystander

At level 3, you learn how to keep other people from interacting with you. As an action, you can spend 10 Spell Points to make yourself invisible. The duration of this effect is equal to your Spell Duration.

As an action, you can dismiss this effect.

This effect ends automatically if you attack or cast a spell.

### Unseen Casting

At level 3, you learn how to keep your spells from giving you away. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Invisible: 10 Spell Points. Make this spell cast and its effects invisible. Casting this spell doesn’t end invisibility effects.

An Invisible spell can’t be seen by anyone but you. An Invisible spell will not give away your location or inform other creatures that it was you who cast it, nor will it end the Bystander effect. An Invisible spell that mentions you in the description instead mentions nobody.

### Safe

At level 5, you learn how to make yourself less vulnerable. As an action, you can spend 10 Spell Points to make yourself ethereal. While you are ethereal:

-   You can pass through walls, creatures, objects, and other tangible materials.
-   You are untargetable and immune to all damage types.
-   Your attacks don’t deal damage.
-   Your spells don’t deal damage, don’t heal, don’t grant 0 temporary hp, can’t kill a creature, and can’t revive a creature.

The duration of this effect is equal to your Spell Duration.

As an action, you can dismiss this effect.

### Watch Together

At level 7, you can bring guests into your world. You can use your Far Watcher Bending Style features on a creature within your Cast Range instead of yourself, including:

-   Bystander
-   Safe
-   Predictive
-   Removed from Reality

The creature must be willing. If they are not, you can attempt to bring them in anyway. If you do, they must make a Wisdom saving throw, and on a failed save, be forced in.

These effects are also bound by your Tether Range. If a creature under one of these effects leaves your Tether Range, these effects end for that creature.

You may use your action to target multiple creatures with multiple effects, as long as all are willing and you have the Spell Points for it.

Creatures that you used your Bystander effect on can see each other, and creatures you used your Safe effect on can interact with each other as normal.

### Predictive

At level 11, you get good at predicting outcomes. Whenever you cast a spell, you can spend 50 Spell Points to simulate it instead. Process the spell like normal. If you like the outcome of the spell, you can commit it to reality and the game continues as normal. If you don’t like the outcome of the spell, you can revert all changes the spell made, and the game continues as if you had not cast that spell.

### Removed from Reality

At level 15, you learn how to change the channel. As an action, you can spend 100 Spell Points to shift to another plane of existence.

## Dreamer

Your dreams have a strange way of effecting reality. When you go to sleep, you cast spells and do things you’d do in a dream. But the things that happened in your dreams happened for real.

### Sleep Walking

At level 3, your mind wanders the plane, conjuring a version of you. Whenever you fall asleep, your dream self appears as an illusion of you within Cast Range of the last person, place, or thing you thought of when going to sleep.

You can see, hear, and sense from your dream self, and you have full control over your dream self. Your dream self is tangible and can interact with objects. You can cast spells from your dream self, using your dream self’s position for the Cast Range and Tether Range.

Your dream self has all your stats and takes damage as normal. If your dream self dies or drops to 0 hit points, it disappears and you wake up. Then you can’t go back to sleep for at least 10 minutes.

You have multiple different dreams at night, as dreams come and go. Dreams always start at a dream target. Dreams can end in multiple different ways:

-   If your dream self becomes further than your Tether Range from your dream target
-   When your dream self is near your dream target for longer than your Spell Duration
-   Your dream self falls to 0 hit points

When your current dream ends, your dream self disappears and you are no longer dreaming.

When a dream ends, you must make a DC15 ability check in your spellcasting ability. On a success, you remember everything that happened in the dream. On a failure, you forget everything that happened in the dream, but can remember one detail about a place you went to, a person you met, or a creature and/or object you saw.

While you’re sleeping but not dreaming,

-   You see only blackness
-   You don’t perceive time
-   You may begin a new dream at any time, provided you have dreams left

You can have a number of dreams per long rest equal to your level in this class divided by 2, rounded up. When you begin a new dream, you may choose a new dream target. You must choose a different dream target for each dream in a long rest.

When a dream begins, you regain all Spell Points. When a dream ends, you lose all Spell Points. While you are awake, you have no Spell Points.

Spells that would normally automatically disappear when you fall asleep instead disappear at the end of a dream.

### Dream Variance

At level 3, your dreams can take on a mind of their own. You have a new stat called Dream Value, which starts at 0 at the start of a dream. Your Dream Value is added to your spellcasting ability modifier, your to-hit bonus for weapons and spells, and saving throws and ability checks that your dream self makes. Your Dream Value is subtracted from your spells’ Spell Point costs, minimum 0.

When your dream self takes damage, reduce your Dream Value by the damage amount divided by 5, rounded up.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Dream Bend: 5 Spell Points. This spell cast refreshes the duration of your current dream and increases your Dream Value by 2.

### Stasis

At level 5, your dreams protect you. Whenever you go to sleep, and at the start of each of your turns while sleeping, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Dream Value, minimum 0. When you wake up, you lose these temporary hit points.

While you have temporary hit points, taking damage doesn’t wake you up.

### Dream Logic

At level 5, your dream self can teleport. As a bonus action, you can teleport your dream self to a space within Cast Range of your dream target.

Whenever your dream self would fall or otherwise be forced to move, you may make an ability check in your spellcasting ability instead. On a success, your dream self doesn’t fall or get moved forcefully, becoming ethereal if necessary to avoid sharing a space with another creature or object. It becomes solid again when it is no longer sharing a space with that creature or object. On a failure, your dream self falls or gets moved forcefully like normal.

### Dream Lucidity

At level 7, you gain better control over your dreams. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Lucid Dreaming: 20 Spell Points. Increase your Dream Value by this spell’s casted level.

As an action, you may end the current dream.

### Sleep Form

At level 7, you’re unbound from your physical form. When you enter a new dream, your dream self can appear as any creature you’ve seen before. It still has your stats and abilities. It gains 1 feature of the chosen creature, and can use that feature once per dream.

### Location Shift

At level 11, you can change locations. When you use your action to end the current dream, you can spend 100 Spell Points to start a new dream immediately and bring any number of other people, things, and/or creatures within your Cast Range with you to the new dream. If a new dream doesn’t begin immediately, this feature has no effect.

Creatures and objects you bring with you teleport to an unoccupied space within your Cast Range at the new location. If there’s not a valid location for a creature or object to land in, it doesn’t get brought through.

### Just a Dream

At level 15, you can fight nightmares. As a reaction, you can end a dream.

When you end a dream, you can undo one negative event that happened in that dream:

-   The death of a player, NPC, or pet. They come back to life with an amount of hit points equal to your Dream Value, minimum 1.
-   The destruction of an item.
-   The casting of a specific spell that was cast within the last round.
-   An action or bonus action that another creature took within the last round.

### Not a Dream!

At level 15, you can wake up in your dream. When a dream ends, you can choose to wake up. When you wake up from a dream, you can choose to teleport to your dream self’s last location.

## Elemental Master

You have an affinity for one element in particular, and you can weave it into your spells and your spellcasting style.

### Elemental Attunement

At level 3, you attune to a particular element. Choose a damage type: fire, cold, lightning, thunder, poison, acid, radiant, force, necrotic, or psychic. This becomes your attuned element. You may attune to an additional element at level 15.

Your weapon attacks within your Cast Range deal an additional 1d6 damage of the type of your attuned element.

You gain the following bond affinity option:

-   Elemental: 3 Spell Points. This spell deals damage of the type of your attuned element instead of its original type, if it deals damage.

### Elemental Recharge

At level 3, you can thrive off your element.

When you deal damage of your attuned element to a creature, you regain Spell Points equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

### Element Style

At level 3, you gain various bonuses, depending on your attuned element:

-   Cold: As a free action, you can move one of your ongoing area of effect spells within Cast Range up to your movement speed on your turn.
-   Fire: When you deal damage, double the number of dice you roll for damage.
-   Lightning: Single target spells can be cast as an action, bonus action, or reaction.
-   Thunder: Every action you take is incredibly loud. Creatures within your Cast Range gain advantage on Stealth rolls, and you gain advantage on Perception checks.
-   Poison: Damaging a creature imposes disadvantage to their next ability check, saving throw, or attack roll.
-   Acid: Damaging a creature lowers their AC by 1. This effect can stack.
-   Radiant: Spells you cast and targets you effect shed light in a 5ft radius. Creatures have advantage when attacking a target you’re lighting up.
-   Force: When you deal damage, creatures you damage must make a Strength saving throw or get knocked 10ft away from you.
-   Necrotic: When you deal 5 or more Necrotic damage to a creature, it becomes marked. A marked creature takes an extra 1d4 necrotic damage whenever they take damage of another type. This effect can stack.
-   Psychic: When you damage a creature, it must choose one feature or spell that it has. It can’t use that chosen feature or spell.

These effects are bound by your Spell Duration and Tether Range.

### Elemental Armor

At level 5, you learn to protect yourself from your own element. You gain resistance to damage of your attuned element.

At level 7, you gain immunity to damage of your attuned element.

At level 11, you gain absorption to damage of your attuned element.

### Elemental Piercing

At level 5, you learn to overcome defenses to your element. If a creature takes normal damage from your elemental damage type, you can instead deal damage to it as if it is vulnerable to your elemental damage type.

At level 7, you can damage a creature with resistance to your elemental damage type as if it didn’t have resistance.

At level 11, you can damage a creature with immunity to your elemental damage type as if it had resistance.

At level 15, you can reduce immunity to normal, resistance to vulnerability, and normal to vulnerability, when dealing damage of your elemental damage type.

### Elemental Trick

At level 7, you become familiar with certain spells.

Spells that deal damage of your attuned element cost 5 Spell Points less to cast. Bending Tricks that deal damage of your attuned element are considered an Elemental Bending Trick. Elemental Bending Tricks cost an additional 5 Spell Points less to cast.

Additionally, you may end one of your active Elemental Bending Tricks as a free action.

### Combo Moves

At level 11, you become experienced in how to combine your spells. When one of your Elemental Bending Tricks ends, you may use your reaction to cast another Elemental Bending Trick, using the position of the last one as the point of reference for the Cast Range of the new one. Both may use the same base spell. The second Elemental Bending Trick’s Spell Point cost is reduced by the first Elemental Bending Trick’s Spell Point cost, minimum 0.

### Elemental Mastery

At level 15, you master your element.

When dealing damage to a creature with immunity to your element, you can instead damage them as if they only had resistance. Likewise, you can reduce resistance to normal, and normal to vulnerability.

You can add any number of bond affinity options to a spell that deals damage of your attuned element.

You can add any number of additional bond affinity options to a spell that you applied the Elemental bond affinity option to.

## Card Bender

Your magic spells manifest as a deck of cards.

### The Deck

At level 3, your magic manifests itself as a deck of cards.

As an action, you may spend 40 spell points to manifest your deck of spells. Each spell and cantrip you know becomes a card in the deck. You must have a free hand to do so.

When you manifest a new deck, any decks you previously manifested disappear.

The deck is volatile. If it leaves your line of sight, it disappears. It is also bound to your Tether Range and Spell Duration.

The deck has only one copy of each card, and they do not get replenished when drawn. When the last card is drawn, the deck disappears, and you must manifest a new deck to use spell cards again.

If you cast a spell normally, if that spell’s card is still in the deck, that card disappears from the deck.

### The Draw

At level 3, you and others may draw from your spell deck.

As an action, you may draw a card from the top of your spell deck. When you draw a card and look at the card front, the spell is instantly cast on you, regardless of its casting time or material component requirements. This is called a Drawn spell.

If the Drawn spell can target one or more creatures, it only targets the card holder. If the Drawn spell is an area of effect spell, the center of the effect is on the card holder. If the card holder is an invalid target for the spell, then the spell has no effect (e.g. a living creature draws Distort Value). If the Drawn spell creates something, it does so in the closest available space to the card holder. The Drawn spell automatically succeeds any to-hit values, and the target automatically fails any Dexterity saving throws for the Drawn spell.

You are the caster of these spells, and the card holder is the target.

However, Drawn spells do not require your concentration. They require the concentration of the deck, and the deck can concentrate on 1 spell per target, and does not need to make a Constitution saving throw if it gets damaged. A Drawn spell does not automatically end when its deck is destroyed. If a creature draws a concentration spell, any previous Drawn concentration spells on them end, if both Drawn spells were drawn from the same deck.

If you’re willing, other creatures can also use this feature to draw a card. Otherwise, they must try to steal a card to draw one.

When a card is drawn and after it is revealed what spell it is, may use your reaction to apply a bond affinity option to it.

### The Hit

At level 3, you may draw for another creature.

You may use your Attack action to draw the top card of the deck without looking at it and use it as a melee weapon. You are proficient with this card weapon and your to-hit bonus is your spellcasting ability modifier.

On a hit, the card targets the creature as if they had drawn the card themselves. On a miss, the card dissipates without casting the spell, and you find out what spell it was.

### The Surprise

At level 3, you can react to luck not going your way. You gain the following Bond Affinity options:

-   Blue Card: 1 Spell Point. This spell deals 2d10 damage instead of its usual effect.
-   Red Card: 1 Spell Point. This spell deals 2d6 damage to the target and all creatures within 5ft of it instead of the spell’s usual effect.
-   Gold Card: 1 Spell Point. This spell stuns the target for 1 round, if the target fails any saving throws for this spell.

### The Fling

At level 5, you can draw cards for creatures at range.

You may use your Attack action to draw the top card of the deck without looking at it and use it as a ranged weapon. Its normal range is equal to your Cast Range, and its long range is equal to your Tether Range. You are proficient with this card weapon and your to-hit bonus is your spellcasting ability modifier.

On a hit, the card targets the creature as if they had drawn the card themselves. On a miss, the card dissipates without casting the spell, and you find out what spell it was.

### The Extra Attack

At level 7, you can attack an additional time when you take the Attack action on your turn.

### The Heart

At level 7, you become attuned to your deck’s ways. Whenever you draw a card and don’t look at the face of it, you may guess information about the spell. For each piece of information you get right about the spell, it is upcast by 1 level. If you guess the name and get it exactly right, it is instantly upcast to 9th level.

For example, if you guess that the first letter of the spell is “T”, that its cast time is 1 action, and that its duration is 10 minutes; and the spell you draw is revealed to be Tidal Wave, you would have correctly guessed 2 pieces of information about it, and the spell would be upcast from 3rd level to 5th level.

### The Trap

At level 11, you can set cards as traps. Draw the top card of the deck without looking at it, and place it facedown on a table, counter, chair, or other surface. The first creature to hold the card and look at its front activates it, and the card targets the creature as if they had drawn the card themselves.

This trap card is bound to your Tether Range and Spell Duration. However, it does not automatically dissipate due to you manifesting a new deck, nor from leaving your line of sight.

### The Filter

At level 15, you learn how to control the randomness of the deck. Whenever you manifest the deck, you may choose to filter the deck to only specific cards. You may filter the deck to only cards that are:

-   Of a certain level or range of levels
-   Of a certain school or schools
-   Targeted spells or area of effect spells

## Death Bender

You use the dead to bend reality to your will.

### Raise the Dead

At level 3, you can exhume dead bodies from their resting place. As an action, spend 2 Spell Points or more to bring a dead body within your Cast Range to life. If it is able, it will spend all its actions and movement to get to your location, digging through as much dirt and opening as many doors as it needs to (only if it is physically capable of doing so) to do so. It then serves you as an undead minion until it collapses.

### Undead Minions

At level 3, you gain control of undead minions. They are bound to your Tether Range and Spell Duration. When they expire, they collapse to the ground as the pile of flesh and bones that they are.

A minion also collapses when:

-   You become unconscious.
-   You are no longer on the same plane as the undead minion.
-   You dismiss it as an action.

Minions start with hit points equal to Xd4 \* the spell points spent to animate it / 2, rounded up, where X is your Reality Bender level. Undead minions can’t be healed by magical or mundane means.

Your minions attack and move on your turn. You can command your undead minions telepathically.

As an action, you may dismiss a particular undead minion, and it collapses.

Undead minions are immune to psychic damage. However, any psychic damage they would take instead gets transferred to you.

### Undead Enchanting

At level 3, you can cast spells on all your undead minions at once. You gain the following bond affinity option:

-   Undead: 10 Spell Points. If this spell targets one or more of your undead minions, it also targets all your undead minions within your Cast Range.

### Undead Immunity

At level 5, you learn how to cast spells without harming your undead minions. You gain the following bond affinity option:

-   Undead Safety: 5 Spell Points. This spell has no effect on your undead minions.

### Undead Fortitude

At level 7, you can syphon the energy of your undead minions. As an action, you may spend 5 Spell Points to consume the energy of one of your undead minions within your Cast Range. You gain hit points equal to that undead minion’s remaining hit points, and the undead minion collapses and shrivels into dust.

Additionally, whenever you drop to 0hp or less, you may use your reaction to dismiss an undead minion. If you do, you come back with 1hp.

### Mass Exhume

At level 11, you can turn the tide of battles with a sudden rise of undead.

As an action, you may target any amount of creatures that you can see within your Cast Range and that have died within your Spell Duration. You may then use your Raise the Dead feature on all of them at once, provided you have the spell points for each one.

### Undead Replacement

At level 15, you use your undead minions as a last resort. When you get hit or take damage, you may use your reaction to teleport any square within Cast Range of one of your undead minions and use your Undead Fortitude feature on it.

## Creature Wrangler

You channel your magic into creatures you can train.

### Magidex

At level 3, you have an encyclopedic knowledge of creatures you see, and recall them and their stats.

### Conjure Them All

At level 3, you can conjure a creature in the shape of a creature you remember with your Magidex feature. You gain the following bond affinity option:

-   Conjured Creature: 20 Spell Points. Conjure this spell as a creature instead of casting it.

A Conjured Creature spell will appear in an open space you designate within your Cast Range. Conjured Creatures are bound by your Tether Range and Spell Duration.

Conjured Creatures spawn with hit points equal to the total amount of Spell Points spent to cast it.

While a Conjured Creature spell is alive, you cannot cast that spell.

When a Conjured Creature spell dies from having its hit points reduced to 0, it disappears, and you cannot cast that spell again until you finish a long rest.

### Creature Party

At level 3, you can have a maximum of 1 Conjured Creature at a time. When you cast another Conjured Creature spell while you already have the maximum allowed out, one Conjured Creature of your choice automatically dissipates. This limit increases as you level up, as shown in the table below:

| Level | Conjured Creature Limit |
|-------|-------------------------|
| 3     | 1                       |
| 5     | 2                       |
| 7     | 3                       |
| 11    | 5                       |
| 15    | 6                       |

Each Conjured Creature has its own turn in the turn order.

### Aggro Threat

At level 3, you get your Conjured Creatures to fight for you.

Whenever a Conjured Creature makes an attack on a creature, that creature has disadvantage on any attack roll not made against a Conjured Creature that attacked it, and the Conjured Creature has advantage on any attack of opportunity attacks it makes on the target creature until its next turn.

### Creature Cast

At level 3, you can cast spells through your Conjured Creatures. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Creature Cast: 5 Spell Points. Cast this spell from one of your Conjured Creatures. If this spell is the same spell as the Conjured Creature’s spell, reduce its Spell Point cost by 20.

### Medical Assistance

At level 5, you can intervene in the fight. As a reaction, you may spend any amount of Spell Points, to heal a Conjured Creature for Xd4, where X is the number of Spell Points spent.

### Leveling Up

At level 7, your Conjured Creatures can level up. After killing an enemy or after a battle, at your DM’s discretion, one or more of your Conjured Creatures can level up. When they do, give it a Bending Trick upgrade.

### Mount

At level 11, some of your Conjured Creatures may be big enough to ride. To be ridable, a Conjured Creature must also be a Bending Trick. It must also resemble a species that is big enough to ride, such as a horse or whale. If it is not, you may spend 10 additional Spell Points to increase its size. It then counts as a mount for you.

You can mount and/or dismount your mount as an action.

While on your mount, your mount moves on your turn, and may take its turn during yours.

### Use Ability!

At level 15, your Conjured Creatures can use the spells they were made with. On its turn, a Conjured Creature can spend 1 hit point to cast its spell, using its position for the spell’s Cast Range and Tether Range. It casts with all the bond affinity options applied to it when it was conjured.

## Reality Scholar

You study reality and hone your skills in manipulating magic.

### Mana Wellspring

At level 3, you have more raw power than other Reality Benders. You gain more Spell Points per level. You gain the Spell Points of 1 level higher than your current level. Ex: At level 3, you gain the Spell Points of a level 4 Reality Bender.

At level 20, you gain 770 Spell Points.

### Spell Warp Study

At level 5, you learn more ways to manipulate your spells. You learn two additional Bond Affinity options when you reach this level. When the class table shows you can learn a Bond Affinity option, you learn 1 additional Bond Affinity option.

You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

This is subject to DM’s approval, of course.

### Mana Overflow

At level 7, you can hold more Spell Points than your maximum.

### Mind Palace

At level 11, you can will your power back to you. As an action, you can focus to regain 1 Spell Point.

### Spell Write

At level 15, you can make your own spells.

You can spend 8 hours of continuous tinkering and study to modify an existing spell’s text for yourself or create an entirely new spell of any level you can safely cast.

Discuss with your DM how the spell should work, how it should be worded, and what level it is. Make sure your DM approves of it before using it.

The new spell and/or modified spell must be from one of your bonded schools.

## Reality Performer

You sing and dance to cast your spells. Basically, a bard-like subclass.

### Performance

At level 3, you can cast your spells with a performance. Choose a performance style that you can do with your spellcasting focus body part. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Performance: 5 Spell Points. Cast this spell centered on yourself, and target all creatures you can see within range.

The range of a Performance spell is any range you choose up to your Cast Range. If the Performance spell has an area of effect, the radius is equal to the range you chose for it. A Performance spell is bound by your performance. It is not bound by your Spell Duration; it lasts as long as your performance does, and always ends automatically when your performance ends. You can end the performance whenever you like as a free action, and it ends automatically when you become unable to perform.

The creatures must also be able to see/hear you, depending on which performance style you chose. Creatures that cannot be charmed cannot be targeted or effected by a performance spell.

Your Performance spell requires concentration, even if the spell doesn’t specifically state it. A Performance spell is not effected by the following Bond Affinity options: Animated, Enduring, Reaching, Remote, Lasting, Ashes.

### Big Show

At level 5, you can weave your performance into another one. Whenever you end your Performance spell as a free action, you can cast a new Performance spell with the same Spell Point cost or lower as the old spell, without paying the Spell Point cost of the new spell.

The new spell is allowed to be the same spell as the old spell.

### Shout Out

At level 7, you can point out a creature in particular. Whenever you use your Big Show feature, you may point out a particular creature you can see within range to make your new Performance spell target only that creature. If you do, you may choose any combination of the following:

-   You have that creature get double the effects of the spell
-   You double your spellcasting ability modifier for the spell

### Damage Mitigation

At level 5, you can keep others from doing harm. Whenever a creature casts a spell, you may use your reaction to do one of the following:

-   Reduce that spell’s damage to 0
-   Change all damage in that spell to giving temporary hp instead
-   Change all damage in that spell to healing instead

Either the creature or the spell must be in your Cast Range.

### Block Slinger

At level 7, you can prevent more harm per turn. If you use your reaction on your Damage Mitigation feature, you have 3 reactions, each of which must be spent on a different option of your Damage Mitigation feature.

### Fast Reaction Speed

## Hunter

You hunt your targets by bending reality around them, leaving them no choice but to walk into your grasp.

### Mark

At level 3, you can mark a creature as your quarry. Take a hair, piece of clothing, or other possession that belongs to your quarry. After 1 minute of focus, you mark that creature as your quarry. You may cast spells on your quarry, or centered on your quarry, if they are within your Tether Range, and you do not need to see them to cast spells on them. You have advantage on initiative checks in combats with your quarry.

You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Seeking: 10 Spell Points. This spell only targets your quarry, and if it has an area of effect, it only effects your quarry.

Seeking spells don’t give away your position, break invisibility, or give any indication that you are the one casting the spell.

### Hunt

At level 5, you can easily kill your quarry. Whenever you deal damage to your quarry, it drops to 0 hp instantly if it has remaining health equal to or less than your execute threshold. Your execute threshold increases as you level up, as shown in the table below:

| Level | Execute Threshold |
|-------|-------------------|
| 3     | 5                 |
| 5     | 10                |
| 7     | 20                |
| 11    | 50                |
| 15    | 100               |

### Sense

At level 7, you can sense your quarry. Make a spellcasting ability check, and your quarry makes the same check. If your value is higher, you know your quarry’s exact location. If their value is higher, you only sense in which direction they are.

### Dead or Alive

At level 11, you can control the lethality of your spells. You learn the following Bond Affinity options:

-   Dead: 10 Spell Points. Creatures effected by this spell are also effected by your execute threshold.
-   Alive: 10 Spell Points. Creatures dropped to 0 hp or less by this spell are instantly stabilized but not woken up.

### Hunting Party

At level 15, you can get help catching your quarry. When you use your Mark feature, you may include other creatures in the 1 minute of focus. When you do, they gain the benefits of that feature on your quarry.

Creatures must be within 10ft of the focus to benefit from it. Creatures you used this feature on are bound by your Spell Duration and Tether Range, and lose the benefits of this feature if those requirements aren’t met.
