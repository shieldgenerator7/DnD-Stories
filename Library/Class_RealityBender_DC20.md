# Reality Bender

You are a spellcaster whose only limitation is your own imagination.

## Starting Equipment

This class grants you no additional starting equipment.

## Reality Bender Spellcasting Path

2025-05-28: copied from DC20 Core Rules Beta 0.9.5

Combat Training: None

Spell List: You choose 1 school of magic. This is your Bonded School. When you learn a new Spell, you can choose any Spell from your Bonded School. You bond to more schools as you level up, as shown in the Reality Bender Class Table.

Cantrips Know: The number of Cantrips you know increases as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Reality Bender Class Table. Cantrips are Spells with the Cantrip Spell Tag.

Spells Known: The number of Spells you know increases as shown in the Spells Known column of the Reality Bender Class Table. These can be Spells with or without the Cantrip Spell Tag.

Mana Points: Your maximum number of Mana Points increases as shown in the Mana Points column of the Reality Bender Class Table.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus.

This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require, even if the spell normally consumes the material components.

When you cast spells, this body part glows, shedding dim light in a 1 space radius. You may choose the color of the glow when you choose the body part.

## Casting Spells

Spells that you cast from your bonded schools have their attributes changed:

-   If the spell has a range greater than Touch or Self, its casting range is changed to your Cast Range
-   Spells that have a duration longer than Instantaneous or 1 round also have their duration changed to your Spell Duration
-   If the spell’s center of effect ever becomes further away from you than the Tether Range, then the spell ends automatically. Leaving the plane counts as leaving your Tether Range.
-   If the spell has an area of effect, its radius is equal to your Area Radius.

Your Cast Range, Spell Duration, Tether Range, and Area Radius are determined by your level as shown in the spellcasting table.

When you cast the spell, you can decide to lower the Cast Range, Spell Duration, Tether Range and/or Area Radius of the spell.

Your spell effects are temporary, even if the spell explicitly states that it is permanent. Objects and creatures that you create are also temporary. Your spell effects automatically disappear/revert when any of the following happens:

-   You fall asleep, go unconscious, or die
-   The center of the spell effect leaves your tether range
-   The spell’s duration expires
-   You leave the plane

Cantrips from your bonded schools are also bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, Spell Duration, and Area Radius.

## Casting Past Your Mana Spend Limit

If the MP you want to spend on a spell is within your Mana Spend Limit, you can safely cast it.

However, as long as you have the MP to cast a spell, you can cast it, regardless of your Mana Spend Limit. To do this, you may dangerously cast a spell.

To dangerously cast a spell, make a Spell Check with a DC equal to 10 plus 3 times the difference between your Mana Spend Limit and the MP spent. Success: you cast the spell. Failure: you don’t cast the spell, but the MP are still spent, and you cannot attempt to cast that spell again until you finish a long rest.

Dangerously Cast DC = 10 + ((Mana Spend Limit – MP spent) \* 3)

You may spend AP to gain ADV on this roll like normal.

## Dispelling Spells

As an action, you may dismiss any ongoing spell that you have cast, even if the spell explicitly stated that it was permanent.

# Reality Bender Class Features

## Level 1 Class Features

### Reality Observer

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. You gain the following reaction:

**Reality Observer**  
Trigger: You see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools  
Reaction: You learn the spell. You must finish a long rest before you are able to first cast the new spell.

### Bond Affinity

You gain affinity for spells in your bonded schools, manipulating them to your will. You gain 2 Bond Affinity options from the list below. You learn more as you level up, as shown in the class table. You can only apply 1 Bond Affinity option to a spell you cast. You can only apply Bond Affinity options to spells in your bonded schools. MP spent on Bond Affinity options counts against your Mana Spend Limit.

-   Capital: 1 MP. Increase your Mana Spend Limit by 3 for this spell cast.
-   Animating: 1 MP. Cast this spell without requiring it to be sustained.
-   Focused: 1 MP. Add your prime modifier to the prime modifier used by this spell cast.
-   Reaching: 1 MP. Increase this spell’s cast range by your Cast Range.
-   Remote: 1 MP. Increase this spell’s tether range by your Tether Range.
-   Lasting: 1 MP. Increase this spell’s spell duration by your Spell Duration.
-   Enduring: 3 MP. This spell doesn’t automatically disappear due to you becoming asleep, unconscious, or dead.
-   Ashes: 0 MP. When this spell would automatically disappear, it instead lingers for 1 minute, then disappears.

### Attribute Limit Change

Your Attribute Limit is replaced with the following table:

| PC Level | Attribute Limit |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1        | +2              |
| 3        | +3              |
| 5        | +4              |
| 7        | +5              |
| 10       | +6              |
| 15       | +7              |
| 17       | +8              |
| 20       | +9              |

### Bending Trick

You know a spell so well you can cast it with ease. Choose a spell you know. It becomes a Bending Trick for you.

When you cast a Bending Trick, you can apply an additional Bond Affinity option to it. Additionally, the Bending Trick costs 1 MP less to cast, minimum 0.

Whenever you level up, you can upgrade an additional spell into a Bending Trick, using the same rules. You may instead upgrade an existing Bending Trick again instead of choosing a new one, using the same rules.

## Level 2 Class Features

### Reality Studier

You can more easily absorb information about spells that you see.

You may spend 1 minute studying an ongoing spell effect to make a Spell Check. The DC is equal to 20 plus the spell’s MP cost minus your Mana Spend Limit. Success: you figure out how to cast the spell and can cast the new spell after a long rest. Failure: you don’t figure out the spell, but may try to study it again immediately.

Reality Studier DC = 20 + spell’s MP cost – Mana Spend Limit

## Level 5 Class Features

### Spell Warp

You can change ongoing spells. When you spend AP to dismiss a spell you cast, you may cast another spell you know for free. The new spell must target the same target(s) as the old spell, and the MP cost of the new spell must be equal to or less than the MP cost of the old spell.

### Recasting

You can keep your spells going longer. You gain the following reaction:

**Recast**  
Trigger: One of your spells ends.  
Reaction: You recast the spell on the same target(s), using the same Bond Affinity option(s), spending any necessary MP.

## Class Capstone Feature

### Reality Command

You gain command of your spells more easily. You may choose a new Bending Trick spell at the start of every month, not just when you level up.

# Subclasses

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Chaos Buildup

You start losing control of your abilities. You gain chaos points (CP) at an alarming rate, that builds up overtime, with no maximum value. As you level up, the rate increases.

| Level | Chaos Buildup Rate |
|-------|--------------------|
| 3     | 1/hour             |
| 6     | 1/minute           |
| 9     | 1/round            |

Additionally, whenever you or a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell from your bonded schools, you gain 1 CP.

You don’t gain CP from this feature while unconscious.

### Chaos Release

You can let out your chaotic urges. You gain the following reaction:

**Chaos Release**  
Trigger: You gain CP.  
Reaction: You cast a spell you know from your bonded schools.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Chaotic: 0 MP. Spend CP for this spell cast instead of MP. Touch this spell cast with your chaos, also touching creatures effected by this spell cast with your chaos.

You don’t gain CP from casting a Chaotic spell.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Chaos Spread

You can’t contain your chaos as it spreads.

When a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell or makes an attack, that spell or attack is also touched by your chaos. A spell that is touched by your chaos causes everything it targets or in its area of effect to also be touched by your chaos. An attack that is touched by your chaos causes its target to also be touched by your chaos, if it hits.

A creature and/or object remains touched by your chaos until:

-   Its chaos duration expires. The chaos duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   It leaves your Tether Range or is no longer on the same plane as you.
-   It uses its action to make a Mental Check against your spell save DC. Success: it is no longer touched by your chaos.
-   You no longer have CP.

A creature touched by your chaos may spend 1 AP to make a Mental Save against your Spell Save DC. Success: it is no longer touched by your chaos.

### Chaos Burn

Your chaos starts undoing reality. Whenever you gain CP, you and things touched by your chaos take true damage, spread evenly amongst all targets. The amount of true damage is equal to your CP minus your MP maximum, minimum of 0.

### Chaos Modifier

Your chaos effects your ability to cast effective spells. While you have CP, your prime modifier is equal to your CP.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Chaotic Luck

Outcomes are randomly changed in unexpected ways. Whenever a d20 is rolled, and you have CP, if it is rolled by you or an effect or creature that is touched by your chaos, its value is warped. If the result is odd, you add your prime modifier to it. If the result is even, you subtract your spell casting ability modifier from it. The result may go above 20 or below 0.

### Lag

Time starts moving at random speeds. At the start of its turn, a creature touched by your chaos must make a Physical Save, with a DC equal to 8 plus your prime modifier. Success: nothing happens. Success (each 5): it gets +1 AP this turn. Failure: it gets -1 AP this turn. Failure (each 5): it gets -1 AP this turn.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Area Modulation

You gain affinity for area of effect spells. You may spend 1 AP to target an existing area of effect spell in your bonded schools, and increase its radius (or diameter) up to an amount depending on your level, as shown in the following chart. Alternatively, you can decrease its radius (or diameter).

|   | Effect Radius Increase | Effect Diameter Increase |
|---|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3 | 1 Space                | 2 Spaces                 |
| 6 | 4 Spaces               | 8 Spaces                 |
| 9 | 20 Spaces              | 40 Spaces                |

The target spell must be within your Cast Range. The radius can’t exceed the Tether Range of the spell, or go below 0. If the radius gets reduced to 0, the spell ends.

You may use this feature on an area of effect spell that you did not cast, as long as it is in your bonded schools. If the spell doesn’t have a Tether Range, you use your Tether Range for determining the max radius you can expand it to.

### Area Permanence

You learn how to make your spells stable long-term.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Permanent: 0 MP. Increase your Tether Range and/or Spell Duration up to infinity for this spell cast, if it has an area of effect. Double the MP cost and casting time for this spell cast.

Permanent spells cost double the MP to cast, and take twice as long to cast. If the cast time is less than 1 minute, the cast time is increased to 1 minute. If a Permanent spell is centered on yourself, another creature, or an object, it is instead centered on a point in space.

You cannot spend AP to dismiss one of your Permanent spells. Instead, you may spend 1 minute and a number of MP equal to the spell’s MP cost to dismiss it. You cannot use this feature to dismiss Permanent spells you did not cast.

You may not move a Permanent spell after casting it, even if the spell specifically states that you can.

Permanent spells don’t require sustaining. Permanent spells do not dissipate automatically when you leave the plane, fall asleep, go unconscious, or die.

Permanent spells are resistant to being countered and dispelled. If a creature attempts to counter it or dispel it, they must make a Spell Check with a DC equal to 10 plus your prime modifier. Success: they counter or dispel the spell, provided the other conditions are met. Failure: the Permanent spell still stands.

You may use your Area Modulation feature on a Permanent spell that you cast, but you must spend 1 MP to do so.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Home Sweet Home

You can begin to call your area your home. Each of your Permanent spells contributes to the combined area called your Permanent Area. Whenever you finish a short rest or long rest in your Permanent Area, you regain all expended MP.

Additionally, while standing in your Permanent Area, your Mana Spend Limit increases by your CM.

### Area Fixation

Other area of effect spells have no effect in your Permanent Area, unless that other spell is also Permanent, or you allow that other spell to effect your Permanent Area.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Area Admin

You gain advanced control over who can access your areas.

You may spend 1 AP to choose a creature that is within your Cast Range and outside your Permanent Area to mark as Banned. At the start of a Banned creature’s turn, if it’s inside your Permanent Area, that creature takes true damage up to your CM and must make a Physical save. Failure: the creature is forced 1 Space toward the closest square not in your Permanent Area. This effect also happens the first time the creature enters your Permanent Area on its turn. If a Banned creature finds itself inside your Permanent Area due to you casting a spell on its location, its Banned mark is removed.

You may spend 1 AP to choose a creature that is within your Cast Range and inside your Permanent Area to mark as Penned. At the start of a Penned creature’s turn, if it’s not inside your Permanent Area, that creature takes true damage up to your CM and must make a Physical save. Failure: the creature is forced 1 Space toward the closest square in your Permanent Area. This effect also happens the first time the creature exits your Permanent Area on its turn. If a Penned creature finds itself outside your Permanent Area due to one of your spells being dispelled, its Penned mark is removed.

You may spend 1 AP to remove a Banned or Penned mark from a creature.

Each mark is permanent, and you may mark an infinite number of creatures. If you attempt to mark a creature you already marked, the new mark replaces the old mark.

If a creature would take damage from this feature, you may instead reduce that damage to any amount, minimum 0. You may choose the maximum damage a creature can take when you mark them, up to your CM.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be. You believe reality is broken, and certain schools of magic are to blame.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Bond Disdain

You can disrupt others who are casting spells in your bonded schools. You may choose 2 Bond Disdain options from the list below. You learn a new bond disdain option whenever you learn a bond affinity option.

-   Costly: Double the amount of MP spent to cast this spell. If the caster can’t pay the cost, the spell fails, still spending any MP they already spent.
-   Close: Half this spell’s cast range.
-   Tethered: Add a Tether Range to this spell cast equal to its caster’s walk speed, or if it already has a Tether Range, half it.
-   Short: Half this spell’s duration, if its duration is longer than 1 round. If the duration is 1 round, the spell ends at the end of the turn instead.
-   Unfocused: Half the spellcaster’s prime modifier for this spell cast, rounded up.
-   Weak: Decrease all healing, damage, and temporary hp this spell grants by 1.
-   Thought Consuming: This spell cast requires sustaining, if it doesn’t already.
-   Ephemeral: This spell cast’s effects are temporary, even if explicitly stated to be permanent. This spell cast automatically dissipates when the caster falls asleep, goes unconscious, or dies.
-   Bumped: This spell cast costs 1 AP extra. If the caster can’t pay the additional AP cost, the spell fails, still spending any MP already spent.
-   Slow: This spell cast takes twice as long to cast, if the cast time is 1 minute or more.
-   Small: Half this spell cast’s radius and/or diameter, if it has an area of effect.
-   Exclusive: Reduce the number of targets this spell cast can target by 1, minimum 0, if this spell can target creatures and/or objects.

You gain the following reaction:

**Magic Disdain**  
Trigger: A creature within your Cast Range casts a spell in your bonded schools.  
Reaction: You apply a bond disdain option to it.

Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range for you to use this feature. You may apply a Bond Disdain option to a spell even if it already has a Bond Affinity and/or Bond Disdain option applied to it.

If a casted spell is a Bending Trick for you, you may apply an additional Bond Disdain option to it for each time that you chose it as a Bending Trick.

When you apply a Bond Disdain option to a spell that you cast, you may reduce the MP cost of that spell by 1 for each Bond Disdain option that you applied to it.

### Easy Dismissal

You have disdain for even your own spells. You may dismiss a spell that you cast as a free action instead of an action.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Peace of Mind

You enjoy the feeling of not being around magic. While there is no magical effect of any spell from your Bonded Schools within your Tether Range, you regain MP as shown in the table below.

| Char Level | MP Gain  |

| 3          | 1/minute |
| 6          | 1/round  |

### Advanced Spell Unraveling

You learn how to stop reality from breaking. You may spend 1 AP to dismiss any ongoing spell effect, if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect. The spell effect must be within your Cast Range.

You learn how to prevent reality from being broken. You gain ADV when contesting a spell with Spell Duel, and the spell costs 1 AP less and 1 MP less, minimum 0.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Perfection

You can stop imperfections from forming. You may spend 1 minute and 2 MP to create an anti-spell field at any point within your Cast Range. The anti-spell field has a radius up to your Cast Range and a duration equal to your Spell Duration, and is bound by your Tether Range.

The anti-spell field causes any spell from your bonded schools that is cast in it or that overlaps with it to fail. Existing spells from your bonded schools that overlap with it are dismissed.

You may use your Vindication feature on spells dismissed and/or prevented by your anti-spell fields.

You may have any number of anti-spell fields active at a time. Your anti-spell fields don’t automatically dissipate when you fall asleep, go unconscious, or die.

You may spend 1 AP to dismiss an anti-spell field that is within your Cast Range.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Affinity Assist

You gain the ability to help others bend reality. You gain the following reaction:

**Bend Spell  
**Trigger: Another creature within your Cast Range casts a spell from your bonded schools  
Reaction: You add one of your Bond Affinity options to the spell

You can use your Bend Spell reaction even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it by someone else. You may not apply a Bond Affinity option that has already been applied with your Spell Sharing feature.

Either the casting creature or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

If the casted spell is a Bending Trick for you, you may apply an additional Bond Affinity option to it for each time you chose it as a Bending Trick.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Bent: 0 MP. Modify this spell cast’s attributes to your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration.

### Spell Sharing

You can give someone else a piece of your power.

You can spend 1 minute to designate another willing creature as a vessel of your power. You must be able to see the creature and they must be within your Cast Range for the whole duration. The creature is now one of your vessels. You can have any number of vessels active at the same time.

You can spend 1 AP to share a spell you know from your bonded schools with a vessel in your Cast Range. The vessel gains the ability to cast the shared spell, expending your MP when they do.

When you share a spell, you may choose a Bond Affinity option to apply to the spell whenever the vessel casts it. You can choose the same Bond Affinity option for multiple shared spells.

While a vessel has a spell, you cannot cast that spell or share it. You can share multiple spells with the same vessel.

A shared spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration, but the ranges use the vessel’s position. A shared spell uses your prime modifier. The spell is limited by your Mana Spend Limit. If a shared spell requires sustaining, the vessel has to sustain it. Every other reference to “you” or “self” in the shared spell refers to the vessel. A vessel gains the benefits of your spellcasting focus when casting a shared spell. If the vessel has a body part similar to your spellcasting focus body part, it glows your spell casting glow color when they cast a spell.

Being a vessel isn’t forever. A creature automatically stops being a vessel if any of the following happens:

-   The vessel duration for the vessel expires. A vessel’s vessel duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   The vessel becomes outside your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   The vessel dies or ceases to exist.
-   The vessel willingly decides to stop being a vessel.
-   You spend 1 AP to make them no longer a vessel.

When a vessel stops being a vessel, all spells you shared with them automatically return to you.

You may spend 1 AP to refresh a vessel’s vessel duration, if the vessel is within your Cast Range. Additionally, whenever you share a spell with a vessel, that vessel’s vessel duration is automatically refreshed.

You may spend 1 AP to take back any number of spells from a vessel, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

You may spend 1 AP to revoke a vessel’s vessel status.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Vessel Network

You can see from your vessels’ points of view. You may spend 1 AP to sense the world through one of your vessel’s point of view. This lasts until you end it as a free action.

Any position that is within Tether Range of a vessel is considered to be within Tether Range of you.

You may use your Reality Observer and Affinity Assist features on spells that a vessel sees. Additionally, you may use your Reality Studier feature on an ongoing spell that a vessel sees if you and that vessel both study it for 1 minute.

### Worship

Your power grows the more your name is said.

At the start of a vessel’s turn, they may say your name, granting you 1 MP.

Additionally, your maximum MP is increased by the number of vessels you have.

### Enhanced Spell Sharing

Your Spell Sharing feature is enhanced.

-   Shared spells are no longer restricted from you when you share them. You can now share a single spell with multiple vessels, and you can now cast it yourself while it is shared.
-   You may refresh the vessel duration of any vessel that is within your Tether Range.
-   Vessels within your Cast Range continuously have their vessel duration refreshed automatically.
-   Each time a vessel casts a spell that you shared with them, their vessel duration is refreshed.
-   You can spend 1 AP to dismiss any shared spell that one of your vessels had casted.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Evangelization

Your vessels can evangelize.

You may spend 1 hour to designate a willing vessel as a prime vessel. You must be able to see the vessel and they must be within your Cast Range for the whole duration. That vessel then becomes a prime vessel.

A prime vessel has the ability to use your Spell Sharing feature to

-   Designate other creatures as vessels of yours
-   Share spells with other vessels. The spells they share must have already been shared with them.
-   Refresh vessel duration of other vessels
-   Revoke shared spells from other vessels
-   Revoke vessel status from other vessels

You may spend 1 AP to telepathically communicate a message to a prime vessel. This doesn’t enable the prime vessel to communicate back to you.

Being a prime vessel is forever, with a few exceptions. A prime vessel automatically stops being a vessel if any of the following happens:

-   The prime vessel dies or ceases to exist.
-   The prime vessel willingly decides to stop being a prime vessel.
-   You spend 1 AP to make them no longer a prime vessel.

You may spend 1 AP to revoke a prime vessel’s vessel state, making them either a regular vessel or just another creature.

## Self-Shaper

You are a self-made person, literally. You modified your being and can modify it to your liking.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

The new Ancestry Trait must be of equal or lesser value than the old Ancestry Trait. Optionally, you may choose 2 new Ancestry Traits, as long as their combined total is less than or equal to the old Ancestry Trait’s cost. You may also choose which part of your appearance changes. If you use this option multiple times, your appearance and ancestry can change completely.
-   Spell (Level 7). Cast a spell you know from your bonded schools that targets only you. You gain the effects of the spell permanently. The spell must either have a duration longer than Instantaneous and 1 round, or have a range of Self or Touch. The spell costs double the MP it normally would. If the spell fails, the MP are still spent, and so is the use of this feature. If the spell succeeds, you can’t cast this spell normally or as part of this feature until you spend a future use of this feature to undo this effect.

What changes are available to you depends on your level.

Using this feature again doesn’t automatically undo previous uses of this feature. However, you may spend a use of this feature to undo the effects of a previous use of this feature.

### Self-Centered

You can always include yourself. Spells that you cast that target you cost 1 MP less to cast. Additionally, you gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Self-Inclusive: 1 AP. Also target yourself with this spell cast if it targets one or more other creatures.

## Luck Bender

Fortune favors you and bends to your will.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Luck Bend

Your spells are lucky. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Lucky: 1 MP. Reroll all dice rolls for this spell cast, and then choose which set of rolls to use.

### Lucky

Luck is on your side. Whenever a d20 is rolled within your Cast Range, you may spend 1 MP to force it to be rerolled, and then the most recent value must be used. Subsequent uses on the same roll cost an extra 1 MP, cumulative. You may use this feature on the same roll a number of times up to your CM.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Good Fortune

Natural luck comes to your aid. You regain 1 MP whenever:

-   You or an ally rolls a 20 on a d20 or crits on an attack roll that hits
-   An enemy creature rolls a 1 on a d20 or fumbles on an attack roll that misses

### Plot Armor

No one can hurt you. Whenever you or another creature must make a saving throw, you may spend any number of MP to decrease the DC by 1 per MP spent.

Additionally, whenever you are attacked, you may spend any number of MP to increase your PD or AD by the number of MP spent, until the start of your next turn.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Luck Dictation

You have mastered fortune. Whenever one or more dice are rolled, but before the outcome is determined, you may spend 5 MP to set any number of the rolled dice to any value possible for that die.

## Item Infuser

You don’t like casting spells directly, and instead prefer to infuse items with your power, and cast spells through them.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Infusing

You gain the ability to infuse an item with a spell.

You may spend 1 hour or more infusing an item you’re holding with a spell from your bonded schools, applying Bond Affinity options as normal. The spell costs double the amount of MP it normally would. Make a Spell check. The DC equals the spell’s MP cost times 2, plus 10, minus the number of hours you spend infusing it. Success: the MP are spent, and the item is infused with the spell. Failure: the MP are still spent, but the item is not infused with the spell.

Once complete, the item can be activated to cast the infused spell. The infused spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration at the time of infusion, but its Cast Range and Tether Range use the item’s position instead of your position. When you infuse the item, you may instead choose to use a lower value for the Cast Range, Tether Range, and/or Spell Duration. The infused spell always uses the Bond Affinity option applied to it when it was infused.

Anyone can hold an infused item and activate its affect. The creature holding the infused item may spend 1 AP to consume a charge and activate the effect. If the item has no charges, nothing happens.

An infused item has a limited number of charges of a spell. It regains all charges at dawn each day. As you level up, the amount of charges you can infuse into an item also increases, as shown in the following table:

| Level | Charges |
|-------|---------|
| 3     | 2       |
| 6     | 3       |
| 9     | 5       |

When you an infuse an item, you may instead choose to infuse a lower number of charges than your level allows.

An item can only be infused with one spell at a time. If you infuse an infused item with another spell, the new spell overwrites the old spell.

Infused items are infused permanently. They don’t lose their infusion when they leave your Tether Range, and they don’t expire after your Spell Duration. You may spend 1 hour to un-infuse a spell from an item.

If the infused spell has range of Self, it targets the active user of the item. If the active user changes to another creature during the spell, the target switches to the new active user. If there is no active user, it targets no one, but does not end the spell early.

If the infused spell requires sustaining, the item sustains the spell itself. Activating a sustained spell a second time ends the spell effect of the previous activations.

The holder of the infused item may use spend 1 AP to dispel any spells cast by the infused item. You may also dispel a spell cast from one of your infused items as if you had cast the spell.

You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Infusable: 1 MP. Lower the DC to infuse this spell by 2 times your Mana Spend Limit.

You can’t use the Infusable Bond Affinity option on a spell that you’re not infusing into an item.

### Instant Refill

You can quickly recharge an infused item. You may spend 1 AP and 1 MP to refill 1 charge to an infused item you can see within your Cast Range.

### Item Upgrading

You can upgrade infused items you’ve previously infused. While holding the infused item, you can spend 1 hour and a number of MP equal to the infused spell’s MP cost to upgrade or downgrade the infused spell’s Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration to be equal to or less than yours. You can also upgrade or downgrade its number of charges. You may also choose to replace the spell’s Bond Affinity option with another Bond Affinity option that you know.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Remote Activation

You can remotely activate items you infuse. You may spend 1 AP to choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You then activate that item. If you can see or have senses of the infused item’s surroundings, you can choose the targets. Otherwise, the infused item automatically targets the closest valid target or area. If the infused item is not in that exact location, this action fails.

### Auto-Activation

You learn how to cause an item to react to a situation. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Reactive: 2 MP. Set a reactive condition for this spell cast, which automatically activates this spell cast’s infused item when met.

You can’t use the Reactive Bond Affinity option on a spell that you’re not infusing into an item.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Multi-Infusing

You learn how to cram more spells into a single item. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Appended: 3 MP. Infuse this spell cast into an infused item without overwriting spells already infused into it.

When an item with multiple infused spells is activated, each spell is activated all in the same turn, in order of infusion, using the same targets, if applicable.

You can’t use the Appended Bond Affinity option on a spell that you’re not infusing into an item.

## Battle Bender

The Formed spell appears as a spectral shape modeled after the piece of equipment you remembered, but has no special effects, and does not cast the spell’s effects when conjured.

The Formed spell has max hp, PD, and MD equal to 10 plus its MP cost.

A Formed spell is very volatile, and dissipates at the end of your turn if:

-   It has 0 hp or less.
-   It was conjured longer ago than your Spell Duration.
-   It is outside your Tether Range or on another plane.
-   It hit the ground or another creature and you are not holding it.
-   It got hit by another creature and you are not holding it.
-   You are asleep, unconscious, or dead.
-   You spent 1 AP to dismiss it.

A Formed spell does not require sustaining to remain formed. You can have multiple Formed spells in existence at once.

### Born to Forge

Conjuring weapons made of magic comes more naturally to you than casting spells.

Spells you cast without a Formed bond affinity option cost an extra 2 MP to cast.

When you cast a Formed spell, you may choose to spend 1 minute casting it instead, if it normally takes 1 AP to cast. If you do, the Formed spell’s MP cost is reduced by your CM.

### Weapon Conjuration

You can conjure spells into a weapon. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Weapon-Formed: 1 MP. Conjure this spell cast into a weapon you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

A Weapon-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure a Weapon-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen weapon that you remembered, with the same damage and properties, but with true damage as the damage type. When it hits, it procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on the target. If it is ranged, it magically conjures its own ammo, and its close range and max range is your Cast Range and Tether Range, respectively. If it is thrown, its close range and max range is your Cast Range and Tether Range, respectively.

You have mastery with your Weapon-Formed spells, and you learn all Attack Maneuvers. Other creatures may also have mastery with them, if it is in the form of a weapon that they have proficiency with.

### Formed Spell Proc

Your Formed spells can cast themselves on a target. When a Formed spell procs this feature on a creature, it casts the Formed spell on them. Any Spell Checks in the spell’s description automatically succeed, and the creature automatically fails any Agility saving throws in the spell’s description. The spell may only target the single creature, even if the spell description says otherwise. If the spell requires sustaining, the spell can’t be sustained.

### Armor Conjuration

You learn to protect yourself with your spells. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Armor-Formed: 2 MP. Conjure this spell cast into a piece of armor you remember and don it, if the spell can target one or more creatures, and has a duration longer than Instantaneous and 1 round.

An Armor-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure an Armor-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen piece of armor that you remembered, with the same PD and AD bonus, but no movement or ability penalty. You can choose to conjure it on a willing creature within your Cast Range instead of yourself.

Whenever you don an Armor-Formed spell, it procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on you. The spell lasts while the armor is donned, and ends automatically when the armor is doffed or it dissipates.

You can only wear one Armor-Formed spell at a time. If you don an Armor-Formed spell while already wearing one, the new one replaces the old one, and the old one dissipates. You may wear an Armor-Formed spell over physical armor.

You have training with your Armor-Formed spells. Other creatures may also have training with them, if it is in the form of a piece of armor that they have training with.

You can force armor onto unwilling creatures. You may attempt to use your Armor Conjuration feature on an unwilling creature, spending MP as normal. Make a Spell check against the creature’s Charisma save. Success: your conjuration succeeds. Failure: your conjuration fails but you still spend the MP.

### Shield Conjuration

You learn how to conjure shields. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Shield-Formed: 2 MP. Conjure this spell cast into a shield you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

A Shield-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure a Shield-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen shield that you remembered, with the same PD and AD bonus.

A creature holding one of your Shield-Formed spells gains the following reaction:

**Spell Shield Intercept**  
Trigger: You or an ally within melee range of you is targeted by an attack  
Reaction: You intercept, imposing DisADV to the attack roll. If the attack misses, your Shield-Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on the attacking creature, if that creature is within your Cast Range.

You have training with your Shield-Formed spells. Other creatures may also have training with them, if it is in the form of a shield that they have training with.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

You can protect yourself with your magic reserves. You may spend 2 AP to gain temporary HP equal to your current MP.

### Extra Attack

Your combat prowess grows. Your second attack each turn ignores the Multiple Check Penalty.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Violent Dismissal

You figure out how to exploit the volatile nature of your Formed spells. You may spend 1 AP to choose one of your Formed spells and make it explode. All creatures in a radius equal to your Cast Range and with line of sight of the Formed spell must make a Agility save. Success: they take true damage equal to the Formed spell’s MP cost divided by 2, rounded down. Failure: they take true damage equal to the Formed spell’s MP cost and the Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on them.

The Formed spell is destroyed immediately when it explodes.

You may target a Formed spell with this feature even if it is outside your Cast Range or Tether Range.

You can get one last use out of your Formed spells. You gain the following reaction:

**Last Word**  
Trigger: One or more of your Formed spells is about to end, or you or another creature you can see dies  
Reaction: You may activate your Violent Dismissal feature on any number of your Formed spells about to dissipate.

## Far Watcher

You don’t really want to participate in reality, and prefer to watch it unfold instead.

### Bystander

You learn how to keep other people from interacting with you. You may spend 1 AP and 1 MP to make yourself invisible. The duration of this effect is equal to your Spell Duration.

You may spend 1 AP to dismiss this effect.

This effect ends automatically if you attack or cast a spell.

### Unseen Casting

You learn how to keep your spells from giving you away. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Invisible: 1 MP. Make this spell cast and its effects invisible. Casting this spell doesn’t end invisibility effects.

An Invisible spell can’t be seen by anyone but you. An Invisible spell will not give away your location or inform other creatures that it was you who cast it, nor will it end the Bystander effect. An Invisible spell that mentions you in the description instead mentions nobody.

### Safe

You learn how to make yourself less vulnerable. You may spend 1 AP and 1 MP to make yourself ethereal. While you are ethereal:

-   You can pass through walls, creatures, objects, and other tangible materials.

You can bring guests into your world. You can use your Far Watcher Bending Style features on a creature within your Cast Range instead of yourself, including:

-   Bystander
-   Safe
-   Predictive
-   Removed from Reality

The creature must be willing. If they are not, you can attempt to force the effect on them. If you do, make a Spell check against their Charisma save. Success: the creature is effected.

These effects are also bound by your Tether Range. If a creature under one of these effects leaves your Tether Range, these effects end for that creature.

You may spend 1 AP to target multiple creatures with multiple effects, as long as all are willing and you have the MP for it.

Creatures that you used your Bystander effect on can see each other, and creatures that you used your Safe effect on can interact with each other as normal.

### Predictive

You get good at predicting outcomes. Whenever you cast a spell, you can spend 2 MP to simulate it instead. This extra MP cost doesn’t count against your Mana Spell Limit. Process the spell like normal. If you like the outcome of the spell, you can commit it to reality and the game continues as normal. If you don’t like the outcome of the spell, you can revert all changes the spell made, and the game continues as if you had not cast that spell.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Removed from Reality

You learn how to change the channel. You may spend 1 AP and 5 MP to shift to another plane of existence. You may bring any number of creatures you used your Watch Together feature on with you.

## Dreamer

Your dreams have a strange way of effecting reality. When you go to sleep, you cast spells and do things you’d do in a dream. But the things that happened in your dreams happened for real.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Sleep Walking

Your mind wanders the plane, conjuring a version of you. Whenever you fall asleep, your dream self appears as an illusion of you within Cast Range of the last person, place, or thing you thought of when going to sleep.

You can see, hear, and sense from your dream self, and you have full control over your dream self. Your dream self is tangible and can interact with objects. You can cast spells from your dream self, using your dream self’s position for the Cast Range and Tether Range.

Your dream self has all your stats and takes damage as normal. If your dream self dies or drops to 0 hp, it disappears and you wake up. Then you can’t go back to sleep for at least 10 minutes.

You have multiple different dreams at night, as dreams come and go. Dreams always start at a dream target. Dreams can end in multiple different ways:

-   If your dream self becomes further than your Tether Range from your dream target
-   When your dream self is near your dream target for longer than your Spell Duration
-   Your dream self falls to 0 hp
-   You spend 1 AP to end the current dream

When your current dream ends, your dream self disappears and you are no longer dreaming.

When a dream ends, you must make a DC15 Mental check. Success: you remember everything that happened in the dream. Failure: you forget everything that happened in the dream, but can remember one detail about a place you went to, a person you met, or a creature and/or object you saw.

While you’re sleeping but not dreaming,

-   You see only blackness
-   You don’t perceive time
-   You may begin a new dream at any time, provided you have dreams left

You can have a number of dreams per long rest equal to your CM. When you begin a new dream, you may choose a new dream target. You must choose a different dream target for each dream in a long rest.

When a dream begins, you regain all MP. When a dream ends, you lose all MP. While you are awake, you have no MP.

Spells that would normally automatically disappear when you fall asleep instead disappear at the end of a dream.

### Dream Variance

Your dreams can take on a mind of their own. You have a new stat called your Dream Value, which starts at 0 at the start of a dream. Your Dream Value is added to your prime modifier for checks and saves that your dream self makes. Your spells have their MP costs reduced by your Dream Value, minimum 0.

When your dream self takes damage, reduce your Dream Value by the damage taken.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Dream Bend: 1 MP. This spell cast refreshes the duration of your current dream and increases your Dream Value by 2.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Stasis

Your dreams protect you. Whenever you go to sleep, and at the start of each of your turns while sleeping, you gain temporary hp equal to your Dream Value, minimum 0. When you wake up, you lose these temporary hit points.

While you have temporary hit points, taking damage doesn’t wake you up.

### Dream Logic

Your dream self can teleport. You may spend 1 AP to teleport your dream self to a space within Cast Range of your dream target.

Whenever your dream self would fall or otherwise be forced to move, you may make a DC10 Spell check instead. Success: your dream self doesn’t fall or get moved forcefully, becoming ethereal if necessary to avoid sharing a space with another creature or object. It becomes solid again when it is no longer sharing a space with that creature or object. Failure: your dream self falls or gets moved forcefully like normal.

Additionally, you’re unbound from your physical form. When you enter a new dream, your dream self can appear as any creature you’ve seen before. It still has your stats and abilities. It gains 2 Ancestry Points with which to spend on Ancestry Traits and/or Beast Traits. It keeps these new Ancestry Traits until the end of the dream.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### Just a Dream

You can fight nightmares. You gain the following reaction:

**End Nightmare**  
Trigger: Anything  
Reaction: You end the current dream.

When you end a dream, you can undo one negative event that happened in that dream:

-   The death of a player, NPC, or pet. They come back to life with an amount of hp equal to your Dream Value, minimum 1.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Elemental Attunement

You attune to a particular element. Choose a damage type: fire, cold, lightning, sonic, poison, corrosion, psychic, radiant, or umbral. This becomes your attuned element. You may attune to an additional element at level 9.

Your weapon attacks within your Cast Range deal an additional 1 damage of the type of your attuned element.

## Card Bender

Your magic spells manifest as a deck of cards.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### The Deck

Your magic manifests itself as a deck of cards.

You may spend 4 AP and 2 MP to manifest your deck of spells. Each spell and cantrip you know becomes a card in the deck. You must have a free hand to do so.

When you manifest a new deck, any decks you previously manifested disappear.

The deck is volatile. If it leaves your line of sight, it disappears. It is also bound to your Tether Range and Spell Duration.

The deck has only one copy of each card, and they do not get replenished when drawn. When the last card is drawn, the deck disappears, and you must manifest a new deck to use spell cards again.

If you cast a spell normally, if that spell’s card is still in the deck, that card disappears from the deck.

### The Draw

You and others may draw from your spell deck.

You may spend 1 AP to draw a card from the top of your spell deck. When you draw a card and look at the card front, the spell is instantly cast on you, regardless of its casting time or material component requirements. This is called a Drawn spell.

If the Drawn spell can target one or more creatures, it only targets the card holder. If the Drawn spell is an area of effect spell, the center of the effect is on the card holder. If the card holder is an invalid target for the spell, then the spell has no effect (e.g. a living creature draws Distort Value). If the Drawn spell creates something, it does so in the closest available space to the card holder. The Drawn spell automatically succeeds any Spell checks, and the target automatically fails any Agility saves for the Drawn spell.

You are the caster of these spells, and the card holder is the target.

The deck sustains all sustained Drawn spells drawn from it, and can sustain a number of active spells at a time equal to your CM. A Drawn spell does not automatically end when its deck is destroyed.

If you’re willing, other creatures can also use this feature to draw a card. Otherwise, they must try to steal a card to draw one.

You gain the following reaction:

Warp Card Effect  
Trigger: A card is drawn from your deck.  
Reaction: You apply a bond affinity option to the Drawn spell.

### The Hit

You may draw for another creature.

You may spend 1 AP and make an Attack check to draw the top card of the deck without looking at it and use it as a melee weapon with a reach of 1 Space. You are trained with this card weapon. Hit: the card targets the creature as if they had drawn the card themselves. Miss: the card dissipates without casting the spell, and you find out what spell it was.

You can draw cards for creatures at range.

You may spend 1 AP to make an Attack check, draw the top card of the deck without looking at it, and use it as a ranged weapon. Its close range is equal to your Cast Range, and its max range is equal to your Tether Range. You are trained with this card weapon. Hit: the card targets the creature as if they had drawn the card themselves. Miss: the card dissipates without casting the spell, and you find out what spell it was.

### The Surprise

You can react to luck not going your way. You gain the following Bond Affinity options:

-   Blue Card: 1 MP. This spell deals 3 damage instead of its usual effect. Regain 2 MP.
-   Red Card: 1 MP. This spell deals 2 damage to the target and all creatures within 1 Space of it instead of the spell’s usual effect.
-   Gold Card: 1 MP. This spell stuns the target for 1 round, if the target fails any saving for this spell.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### The Heart

You become attuned to your deck’s ways. Whenever you draw a card and don’t look at the face of it, you may guess information about the spell. For each piece of information you get right about the spell, its MP cost is reduced by 1, minimum 0. If you guess the name and get it exactly right, its MP cost is set to 0.

For example, if you guess that the first letter of the spell is “T”, that its cast time is 1 action, and that its duration is 10 minutes; and the spell you draw is revealed to be Tidal Wave, you would have correctly guessed 2 pieces of information about it, and the spell would be have its MP cost reduced by 2.

### The Trap

You can set cards as traps. Draw the top card of the deck without looking at it, and place it facedown on a table, counter, chair, or other surface. The first creature to hold the card and look at its front activates it, and the card targets the creature as if they had drawn the card themselves.

This trap card is bound to your Tether Range and Spell Duration. However, it does not automatically dissipate due to you manifesting a new deck, nor from leaving your line of sight.

### Subclass Capstone Feature

### The Filter

You learn how to control the randomness of the deck. Whenever you manifest the deck, you may choose to filter the deck to only specific cards. You may filter the deck to only cards that are:

-   From a certain spell list or spell lists
-   From a certain school or schools
-   Targeted spells or area of effect spells

## Death Bender

You use the dead to bend reality to your will.

### Level 3 Subclass Features

### Raise the Dead

You can exhume dead bodies from their resting place. You may spend 1 AP and 1 MP or more to bring a dead body within your Cast Range to life. If it is able, it will spend all its actions on movement to get to your location, digging through as much dirt and opening as many doors as it needs to (only if it is physically capable of doing so) to do so. It then serves you as an undead minion until it collapses.

### Undead Minions

You gain control of undead minions. They are bound to your Tether Range and Spell Duration. When they expire, they collapse to the ground as the pile of flesh and bones that they are.

A minion also collapses when:

-   You become unconscious.
-   You are no longer on the same plane as the undead minion.
-   You spend 1 AP to dismiss it.

Minions start with hit points equal to your CM times the MP spent to animate it. Undead minions can’t be healed by magical or mundane means.

Your minions attack and move on your turn. You can command your undead minions telepathically.

You may spend 1 AP to dismiss a particular undead minion, and it collapses.

Undead minions are immune to psychic damage. However, any psychic damage they would take instead gets transferred to you.

• Undead Safety: 1 MP. This spell has no effect on your undead minions.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

Conjured Creatures spawn with HP equal to the total amount of AP and MP spent to cast it.

While a Conjured Creature spell is alive, you cannot cast that spell.

When a Conjured Creature spell dies from having its HP reduced to 0, it disappears, and you cannot cast that spell again until you finish a long rest.

### Creature Party

You can have a maximum of amount of Conjured Creatures at a time equal to your CM + 1. When you cast another Conjured Creature spell while you already have the maximum allowed out, one Conjured Creature of your choice automatically dissipates.

Each Conjured Creature has its own turn in the turn order.

### Aggro Threat

You get your Conjured Creatures to fight for you.

Whenever a Conjured Creature makes an attack on a creature, that creature has DisADV on any attack roll not made against a Conjured Creature that attacked it, and the Conjured Creature has ADV on any attack of opportunity attacks it makes on the target creature until its next turn.

### Level 6 Subclass Features

### Creature Cast

You can cast spells through your Conjured Creatures. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

### Medical Assistance

You can intervene in the fight. You gain the following reaction:

**Emergency Assistance**  
Trigger: Anything  
Reaction: You spend any amount of MP to heal a Conjured Creature for an amount of HP equal to your CM times the MP spent.

You can end the performance whenever you like as a free action, and it ends automatically when you become unable to perform.

The Performance spell’s area of effect is always a sphere centered on yourself, ignoring what the spell description says. You can choose if the area of effect includes you or not.
