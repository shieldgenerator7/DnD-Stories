## Equipment

This class grants you no additional starting equipment.

# Spellcasting

Choose one ability to be your spellcasting ability. This will be your Reality Bender ability.

## Bonded Schools

Choose a school of magic as your bonded school. You bond to more schools as you level up, as shown in the class table. You get special bonuses when casting spells in your bonded schools as you level up.

At level 1, you know 1 cantrip and 1 1st-level spell, both from your bonded school. As you level up, the minimum amount of spells you know of 1st level or higher is equal to your level. When you level up, you may learn one 1st-level spell from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus. This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require.

## Cantrips

At level 1, choose one cantrip of your choice from the list of spells in your bonded school. You learn additional cantrips as you adventure in the world.

## Casting Spells

The class table shows how many spell slot points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell slot points equal to the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slot points when you finish a long rest.

Spells that you cast from your bonded schools have their attributes changed. If the spell has a range greater than touch, its max casting range is changed to the Cast Range based on your level as shown in the class table. Spells that have a duration longer than Instant also have their max duration changed to the Max Duration based on your level as shown in the class table. These spells also have a new stat called Tether Range. If the spell’s center of effect ever becomes further from you than the tether range, then the spell ends automatically.

As an action, you may dispel any spell that you had casted from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Ability

Choose an ability among Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. This will be your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use this chosen spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

## Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a level, you can learn one spell of your choice. This spell must be of level 1. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can learn. This class does not grant you the ability to learn spells from outside your bonded schools.

# Reality Observer

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. At level 1, whenever you see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to automatically learn that spell, no matter what level it is.

# Bond Affinity

At level 1, you gain affinity for spells in your bonded schools. You learn one Bond Affinity option. You can use this feature to gain bonuses when casting these spells. When you cast a spell in your bonded schools, you can choose one bond affinity option that you learned to apply to it. You gain bond affinity options as you level up, as shown in the class table. You may not unlearn a Bond Affinity option, and when you may learn a new Bond Affinity option, you may not replace a Bond Affinity option you already learned.

-   Adamant: You can add your chosen spellcasting ability modifier an additional time to this spell cast’s spell save DC and/or spell attack modifier.
-   Conserving: After casting this spell, regain spell slot points equal to this spell’s printed level.
-   Quick: You may cast this spell as a bonus action, as long as the spell’s cast time is 1 action.
-   Upcast: When you cast this spell, it gets upcast to twice its level.
-   Reaching: The cast range for this spell is doubled.
-   Remote: The tether range for this spell is doubled.
-   Lasting: The max duration for this spell is doubled.
-   Animating: You cast this spell as if it didn’t have concentration.

# Subclassing

At level 3, you choose a subclass, as listed below.

-   Reality Breaker
-   Reality Forger
-   Reality Fixer
-   Reality Sharer

# Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. However, you may increase your chosen spellcasting ability by 1, even if it goes above 20, if you decrease another ability by 1 when you do so.

# Reality Studier

At level 7, when you learn a new spell in your bonded schools, you gain spell slot points equal to that spell’s casted level.

# Rejuvenation

At level 9, when you cast a spell from your bonded schools, you heal for the number of spell slot points spent to cast it.

# Energy Store

At level 11, when you use an action to dispel a spell you cast, you gain back spell slot points equal to the spell’s printed level.

# Recasting

At level 13, when one of your spells ends, you sense it, and may use your reaction to recast the spell on the same target(s), using the same Bond Affinity option.

# Refill

At level 15, you can replenish your spell slot points. As a bonus action, add spell slot points equal to your current health to your spell slot points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Subclasses

At level 3, you choose a subclass.

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

At level 3, you start losing control of your abilities. Whenever a creature effected by your chaos (including you) casts a spell, you gain chaos points equal to that spell’s printed level. Whenever you gain chaos points, you may use your reaction to expend all chaos points to cast a spell from your bonded schools.

You may spend chaos points to cast spells as if they were spell slot points.

Only you are effected by your chaos by default. When a creature effected by your chaos (including you), casts a spell or makes an attack, that spell or attack is also effected by your chaos. Spells that are effected by your chaos cause their targets and/or creatures and/or objects in their area of effect to be effected by your chaos for the duration of the spell and for 1 minute afterwards.

### Chaos Burn

At level 3, your chaos starts undoing reality. At the start of each of your turns, you gain 1 chaos point. Then you and things effected by your chaos take force damage equal to your chaos points divided by 10, rounded down, minus your level, minimum of 0.

### Luck Warping

At level 7, random events happen. Whenever a d20 is rolled, if it is rolled by an effect or creature that is effected by your chaos, its value is warped. If the result is odd, you add your chaos points to it. If the result is even, you subtract your chaos points from it. The result may go above 20 or below 0.

### Origin Shifting

At level 11, the points of origin shift around you in unnatural ways. The origin point of spells and attacks effected by your chaos shift in your shifting direction. Your shifting direction gets set to your current facing direction whenever you cast a spell using a chaos point. Origin points shift in this direction by an amount equal to your chaos points, rounded up to the nearest 5.

When a creature effected by your chaos moves on their turn, they first teleport in your shifting direction, then move from there.

### Lag

At level 15, time starts moving at random speeds. At the start of its turn, a creature effected by your chaos must make a Constitution ability check. The DC is equal to your chaos points divided by 5, rounded up. If it gets below the DC, its turn is skipped. If it gets 20 minus the DC or above, it gets to take 2 actions this turn. However, if the DC is 10 or above, and the roll lands in the overlap area, nothing special happens.

### Unstable

At level 20, spells become unpredictable. When a spell is cast, if it is effected by your chaos, it has all numbers in its stats and description increased by your chaos points.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Area Creation

At level 3, spells you cast in your bonded schools that target an area have an infinite duration, as long as the spell has a duration longer than Instant, and its area of effect radius or diameter is doubled.

### Area Fixation

At level 7, spells you cast in your bonded schools that target an area prevent other spells that target an area from effecting its area, unless that other spell is cast by you.

### Area Manipulation

At level 11, you become adept at manipulating areas. Spells you cast that target an area can have 2 Bond Affinity options applied to them.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be.

### Cure

At level 3, you learn how to fix reality. As an action, you can dismiss any spell effect from your bonded schools even if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect.

### Prevention

At level 7, you learn how to prevent reality from being broken. As a reaction, you can counter any spell within range from your bonded schools.

### Restoration

At level 11, you learn how to absorb spells. When you use Cure or Prevention on a spell, you gain spell slot points equal to that effected spell’s level.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Sharing

At level 3, you can give someone else a piece of your power. As an action, you can target another willing creature you can see within range to gain a spell you know from your bonded schools. That creature gains the ability to cast the spell as if you were casting it, expending your spell slot points when they do. While this spell is shared, you cannot cast it. As an action, you may take back this power as long as you can see the creature you gave it to and they are within range.

### Caring

At level 7, you gain the ability to help others bend reality. When another creature in range casts a spell that you know from your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to add one of your Bond Affinity options to it. You can do this even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it.

### Bonding

At level 11, you can bond your spells with others. Whenever you cast a spell from your bonded schools, each creature that has a piece of your power may use its reaction to cast the same spell you cast at the same level, with the same Bond Affinity option.

## Self-Shaper

You are a self-made person, literally. You modified your being and can modify it to your liking.

### Hardy

At level 3, you can adapt to any environment. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself immunity to any 1 damage type. This lasts until you use this feature again.

### Unfaltering

At level 5, whenever you roll for an ability check or saving throw, you may add your spellcasting ability modifier to it.

### Quick

At level 7, you can quickly protect yourself from any threat. As a reaction, you can cast a spell that targets you, if that spell normally has a cast time of 1 action or 1 bonus action.

### Selfish

At level 11, you can redirect magic into you. As a reaction, change a spell’s target to yourself, if it is targeting another creature. Regain spell slot points equal to the spell’s casted level.

### Identity

At level 15, you can modify yourself even more easily. Whenever you cast a spell that targets yourself, you can double the result of any and all rolls for that spell.

## Luck Bender

Fortune favors you and bends to your will.

### Lucky

At level 3, luck is on your side. Once per turn, whenever a d20 is rolled within your cast range, you may have that d20 be rerolled, and then you choose which roll to use.

### Willful

At level 7, reality bends to your will. The spell save DC and spell attack modifier of spells you cast are increased by your spellcasting ability modifier an additional time.

### Fortunate

At level 13, you can hardly fail. You get advantage on all ability checks and saving throws.

### Plot Armor

At level 15, no can hurt you. Whenever you have to make a saving throw, the DC is lowered by your spellcasting ability modifier. Additionally, any attack roll against you has disadvantage.

### Dictation

At level 20, you have mastered fortune. As a reaction, you can set any number of rolled dice to any value possible for that die.
