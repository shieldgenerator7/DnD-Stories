## Equipment

# Spellcasting

You are a spell caster whose only limitation is your own imagination.

## Bonded Schools

Choose a school of magic as your bonded school. You bond to more schools as you level up, as shown in the class table. You get special bonuses when casting spells in your bonded schools. This class only grants you the ability to learn and cast spells from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus. This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require, even if the spell normally consumes the material components.

## Casting Spells

The class table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell points equal to the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells that you cast from your bonded schools have their attributes changed. If the spell has a range greater than Touch or Self, its casting range is changed to your Cast Range based on your level as shown in the class table. Spells that have a duration longer than Instantaneous also have their duration changed to your Spell Duration based on your level as shown in the class table. These spells also have a new stat called Tether Range. If the spell’s center of effect ever becomes further away from you than the tether range, then the spell ends automatically.

As an action, you may dispel any spell that you had casted from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Ability

Choose an ability among Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. This will be your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use this chosen spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

## Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

At level 1, you know 1 cantrip and 1 1st-level spell, both from your bonded school. As you level up, the minimum amount of spells you know of 1st level is equal to your level. When you level up, you may learn one 1st-level spell from your bonded schools.

You learn additional cantrips and spells as you adventure in the world, using your Reality Observer feature.

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. At level 1, whenever you see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to automatically learn that spell, no matter what level it is.

# Bond Affinity

At level 1, you gain affinity for spells in your bonded schools, getting bonuses when casting these spells. When you cast a spell in your bonded schools, you can choose one Bond Affinity option that you learned to apply to it.

You learn one Bond Affinity option. You gain Bond Affinity options as you level up, as shown in the class table. You may not unlearn a Bond Affinity option, and when you may learn a new Bond Affinity option, you may not replace a Bond Affinity option you already learned.

-   Increase one ability score of your choice by 2, max 20
-   Increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, max 20
-   Increase your spellcasting ability score by 1, max 30

# Reality Studier

At level 7, when you learn a new spell in your bonded schools, you gain spell points equal to that spell’s casted level.

# Rejuvenation

At level 9, when you cast a spell from your bonded schools, you heal for the number of spell points spent to cast it.

# Energy Store

At level 11, when you use an action to dispel a spell you cast, you gain back spell points equal to the spell’s printed level.

# Recasting

At level 13, when one of your spells ends, you sense it, and may use your reaction to recast the spell on the same target(s), using the same Bond Affinity option.

# Refill

At level 15, you can replenish your spell points. As a bonus action, add spell points equal to your current health to your spell points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Subclasses

At level 3, you choose a subclass.

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

### Chaos Buildup

At level 3, you start losing control of your abilities. You gain chaos points at an alarming rate, that builds up overtime, with no maximum value. As you level up, the rate increases.

|    | Chaos Buildup Rate |
|----|--------------------|
| 3  | 1/day              |
| 5  | 1/hour             |
| 7  | 1/minute           |
| 11 | 1/round            |
| 15 | 10/round           |

Additionally, whenever you or a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell from your bonded schools, you gain chaos points equal to that spell’s base level.

### Chaos Release

At level 3, you can let out your chaotic urges. Whenever you gain chaos points, you may use your reaction to cast a spell you know from your bonded schools.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Chaotic: This spell costs chaos points instead of spell points, and is touched by your chaos. Creatures effected by this spell become touched by your chaos.

### Chaos Spread

At level 3, you can’t contain your chaos as it spreads.

When a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell or makes an attack, that spell or attack is also touched by your chaos. A spells that is touched by your chaos causes everything it targets or in its area of effect to also be touched by your chaos.

A creature and/or object remains touched by your chaos until:

-   Its chaos duration expires. The chaos duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   It leaves your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   It uses its action to make a Wisdom ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer touched by your chaos.

### Chaos Burn

At level 3, your chaos starts undoing reality. Whenever you gain chaos points, you and things touched by your chaos each take force damage equal to your chaos points divided by 10, rounded down, minus your level, minimum of 0.

### Chaos Modifier

At level 3, your chaos effects your ability to cast effective spells. While you have chaos points, your spellcasting ability modifier is changed to your chaos points divided by 5, rounded up.

### Luck Warping

At level 5, outcomes are randomly changed in unexpected ways. Whenever a d20 is rolled, if it is rolled by you or an effect or creature that is touched by your chaos, its value is warped. If the result is odd, you add your chaos points to it. If the result is even, you subtract your chaos points from it. The result may go above 20 or below 0.

### Origin Shifting

At level 7, the points of origin shift around you in unnatural ways. The origin point of spells and attacks touched by your chaos shift in your shifting direction. Your shifting direction gets set to your current facing direction whenever you cast a spell using the Chaotic Bond Affinity option. Origin points continually shift in this direction by an amount equal to your chaos points, rounded up to the nearest 5.

When a creature touched by your chaos moves on their turn, they first teleport in your shifting direction, then move from there.

### Lag

At level 11, time starts moving at random speeds. At the start of its turn, a creature touched by your chaos must make a Constitution ability check, with a DC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, max 10. If it gets below the DC, its turn is skipped. If it gets 20 minus the DC or above, it gets to take 2 actions this turn.

### Unstable

At level 15, spells become unpredictable. When a spell is cast, if it is touched by your chaos, it has all numbers in its stats and description increased by your chaos points.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Area Creation

At level 3, you gain affinity for area of effect spells. As a bonus action, you may target an existing area of effect spell in your bonded schools, and increase its radius by 5ft or its diameter by 10ft. Alternatively, you can decrease its radius or diameter by the same amount.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Wide: The effect radius and/or diameter is doubled for this spell cast, if it has an area of effect.

### Home Advantage

At level 5, you can begin to call your area your home. While standing within one of your Permanent spells, you gain 1 spell point at the start of each of your turns.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Permanent: Your Tether Range and Spell Duration are both infinite for this spell cast. This spell cast costs twice as many spell points.

### Area Fixation

At level 7, your Permanent spells prevent other area of effect spells from effecting its area, unless that other spell is cast by you.

### Area Manipulation

At level 11, you become adept at manipulating areas. Area of effect spells you cast in your bonded schools can have 2 Bond Affinity options applied to them.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be.

### Halt

At level 3, you learn how to stop reality from breaking. As an action, you can dismiss any spell effect from your bonded schools even if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect. The spell effect must be within your Cast Range.

### Prevention

At level 5, you learn how to prevent reality from being broken. As a reaction, you can counter any spell from your bonded schools. Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

### Vindication

At level 7, you learn how to absorb spells. When you use Halt or Prevention on a spell, you gain spell points equal to the effected spell’s level.

### Restoration

At level 11, you learn how to undo spells. As an action, you may undo the effects of any spell from your bonded schools. The spell must be within Cast Range and must have been cast no longer ago than your Spell Duration.

### Perfection

At level 15, you can stop imperfections from forming. As an action, you can create an anti-spell field at any point within your Cast Range. The anti-spell field has a radius up to your Cast Range and a duration equal to your Spell Duration. The anti-spell field causes any spell from your bonded schools that is cast in it or that overlaps with it to fail.

As an action, you may dismiss an anti-spell field that is within your Cast Range.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Affinity Assist

At level 3, you gain the ability to help others bend reality. When another creature casts a spell from your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to add one of your Bond Affinity options to it. You can do this even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it. Either the casting creature or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Bent: The spell’s attributes are modified to have your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration.

### Spell Sharing

At level 5, you can give someone else a piece of your power. As an action, you can share a spell you know from your bonded schools with another willing creature within your Cast Range. That creature becomes a vessel of your power, and gains the ability to cast the shared spell, expending your spell points when they do.

When you share a spell, you may choose a Bond Affinity option to apply to the spell whenever the vessel casts it. You can choose the same Bond Affinity option for multiple shared spells.

While a vessel has a spell, you cannot cast that spell or share it. You can have any number of vessels active at the same time, up to the number of spells you know. You can share multiple spells with the same vessel.

A shared spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration, but the ranges use the vessel’s position. A shared spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack modifiers, if applicable. If a shared spell requires concentration, it uses the concentration of the vessel. Every other reference to “you” or “self” in the shared spell refers to the vessel. A vessel gains the benefits of your spellcasting focus when casting a shared spell.

Spells shared with vessels don’t stay shared forever. A shared spell automatically returns to you if any of the following happens:

-   The share duration for the spell expires. A shared spell’s share duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   The vessel becomes outside your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   The vessel dies or ceases to exist.

As an action, you may refresh a vessel’s spells, refreshing the share duration of all spells shared with them, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

As an action, you may take back any number of spells from a vessel, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

When a vessel no longer has any of your shared spells, they are no longer considered a vessel.

### Vessel Casting

At level 5, you can cast spells from your vessels. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Vessel Casting: Cast this spell from a vessel, using their position to determine if the spell is within your Cast Range.

### Vessel Network

At level 7, you can see from your vessels’ points of view. Any position that is within Tether Range of a vessel is considered to be within Tether Range of you.

You may use your Reality Observer and Affinity Assist features on spells that a vessel sees.

### Worship

At level 11, your power grows the more your name is said. A vessel may use its bonus action to say your name, granting you spell points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

A vessel may spend 1 minute to praise you, granting you spell points equal to your spellcasting ability score.

Once a vessel uses this feature, they can’t do so again until they finish a short or long rest.

### Unity

At level 15, you can unify your vessels in casting a spell. Whenever you cast a spell from your bonded schools, each of your vessels may use their reaction to cast the same spell you cast at the same level, with the same Bond Affinity option.

## Self-Shaper

You are a self-made person, literally. You modified your being and can modify it to your liking.

### Moldable

At level 3, you can modify yourself easily. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may cast a spell on yourself without spending spell points. The spell must have a duration longer than Instantaneous or have a range of Self or Touch. The spell may not have an area of effect or target other creatures other than you. The duration of the spell is unaffected by your Spell Duration, and lasts until you finish another long rest.

### Flexible

At level 5, you can flex your skills to your liking. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may increase an ability score of your choice by up to your spellcasting ability modifier, by decreasing another ability score of your choice by the same amount. This feature allows an ability score to exceed 20, but not above 30.

This change is permanent, but may be undone by a future use of this feature.

Additionally, effects that grant ability score improvements may increment an ability score above 20, but not above 30.

### Fluid

At level 7, whenever you finish a long rest, you may switch out one of your bonded schools for a different school that you don’t know. You still remember spells from your old bonded school, but can’t cast any spells you know from that school or use your Reality Observer feature to learn new spells in that school.

This change is permanent, but may be undone by a future use of this feature.

### Shape Changer

At level 11, whenever you finish a long rest, you may change your race. You lose the bonuses from your old race and gain the benefits of your new race. You must have seen the race you switch to at least once.

This change is permanent, but may be undone by a future use of this feature.

### Hardy

At level 3, you can adapt to any environment. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself immunity to any 1 damage type. This lasts until you use this feature again.

### Unfaltering

At level 5, whenever you roll for an ability check or saving throw, you may add your spellcasting ability modifier to it.

### Quick

At level 7, you can quickly protect yourself from any threat. As a reaction, you can cast a spell that targets you, if that spell normally has a cast time of 1 action or 1 bonus action.

### Selfish

At level 11, you can redirect magic into you. As a reaction, change a spell’s target to yourself, if it is targeting another creature. Regain spell points equal to the spell’s casted level.

### Identity

At level 15, you can modify yourself even more easily. Whenever you cast a spell that targets yourself, you can double the result of any and all rolls for that spell.

## Luck Bender

Fortune favors you and bends to your will.

### Lucky

At level 3, luck is on your side. Once per turn, whenever a d20 is rolled within your cast range, you may have that d20 be rerolled, and then you choose which roll to use.
