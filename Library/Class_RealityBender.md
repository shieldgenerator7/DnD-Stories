## Equipment

This class grants you no additional starting equipment.

# Spellcasting

You are a spell caster whose only limitation is your own imagination.

## Bonded Schools

Choose a school of magic as your bonded school. You bond to more schools as you level up, as shown in the class table. You get special bonuses when casting spells in your bonded schools. This class only grants you the ability to learn and cast spells from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus. This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require, even if the spell normally consumes the material components.

## Casting Spells

The class table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell points equal to the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells that you cast from your bonded schools have their attributes changed. If the spell has a range greater than Touch or Self, its casting range is changed to your Cast Range based on your level as shown in the class table. Spells that have a duration longer than Instantaneous also have their duration changed to your Spell Duration based on your level as shown in the class table. These spells also have a new stat called Tether Range. If the spell’s center of effect ever becomes further away from you than the tether range, then the spell ends automatically.

As an action, you may dispel any spell that you had casted from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Ability

Choose an ability among Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. This will be your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use this chosen spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

## Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

At level 1, you know 1 cantrip and 1 1st-level spell, both from your bonded school. As you level up, the minimum amount of spells you know of 1st level is equal to your level. When you level up, you may learn one 1st-level spell from your bonded schools.

You learn additional cantrips and spells as you adventure in the world, using your Reality Observer feature.

When you’re starting a new campaign at 2nd level or higher, you may have already seen a few spells in your bonded schools. At your DM’s discretion, you may roll an ability check in your spellcasting ability to see if you’ve seen the spell be cast before, or have imagined it before. The DC is equal to the spells’ level times 2, plus 10, plus the number of spells you already know of the same level, minus your level in this class. Your DM may modify this DC at their discretion. On a success, you know the spell.

# Reality Observer

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. At level 1, whenever you see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to automatically learn that spell, no matter what level it is.

# Bond Affinity

At level 1, you gain affinity for spells in your bonded schools, getting bonuses when casting these spells. When you cast a spell in your bonded schools, you may choose up to one Bond Affinity option that you learned to apply to it:

-   Focused: Double your spellcasting ability modifier for this spell cast.
-   Powerful: Double any and all dice rolls that you roll for this spell cast.
-   Replenishing: Regain spell points equal to this spell’s base level after casting this spell.
-   Quick: Cast this spell as a bonus action, if the spell’s cast time is 1 action.
-   Capital: Upcast this spell cast to twice its casted level.
-   Reaching: Double your Cast Range for this spell cast.
-   Remote: Double your Tether Range for this spell cast.
-   Lasting: Double your Spell Duration for this spell cast.
-   Animating: Cast this spell without requiring concentration.

You learn one Bond Affinity option at level 1. You gain Bond Affinity options as you level up, as shown in the class table. You may not unlearn a Bond Affinity option, and when you may learn a new Bond Affinity option, you may not replace a Bond Affinity option you already learned.

Bending Styles may also grant you extra Bond Affinity options. These do not count against the total Bond Affinity options that you know as shown in the class table.

# Bending Style

At level 3, you choose a Bending Style, as listed below. The Bending Style you choose will give you features at levels 3, 5, 7, 11, and 15. They will also grant you bonus Bond Affinity options.

-   Reality Breaker
-   Reality Forger
-   Reality Fixer
-   Reality Sharer
-   Self-Shaper
-   Luck Bender
-   Item Infuser

# Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can do one of three things:

-   Increase one ability score of your choice by 2, max 20
-   Increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, max 20
-   Increase your spellcasting ability score by 1, max 30

# Reality Studier

At level 7, when you learn a new spell in your bonded schools, you gain spell points equal to that spell’s casted level.

# Rejuvenation

At level 9, when you cast a spell from your bonded schools, you heal for the number of spell points spent to cast it.

# Energy Store

At level 11, when you use an action to dispel a spell you cast, you gain back spell points equal to the spell’s printed level.

# Recasting

At level 13, when one of your spells ends, you sense it, and may use your reaction to recast the spell on the same target(s), using the same Bond Affinity option.

# Refill

At level 15, you can replenish your spell points. As a bonus action, add spell points equal to your current health to your spell points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Bending Styles

At level 3, you choose a Bending Style.

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

### Chaos Buildup

At level 3, you start losing control of your abilities. You gain chaos points at an alarming rate, that builds up overtime, with no maximum value. As you level up, the rate increases.

| Level | Chaos Buildup Rate |
|-------|--------------------|
| 3     | 1/day              |
| 5     | 1/hour             |
| 7     | 1/minute           |
| 11    | 1/round            |
| 15    | 10/round           |

Additionally, whenever you or a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell from your bonded schools, you gain chaos points equal to that spell’s base level.

### Chaos Release

At level 3, you can let out your chaotic urges. Whenever you gain chaos points, you may use your reaction to cast a spell you know from your bonded schools.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Chaotic: Spend chaos points for this spell cast instead of spell points. Touch this spell cast with your chaos, also touching creatures effected by this spell cast with your chaos.

### Chaos Spread

At level 3, you can’t contain your chaos as it spreads.

When a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell or makes an attack, that spell or attack is also touched by your chaos. A spell that is touched by your chaos causes everything it targets or in its area of effect to also be touched by your chaos.

A creature and/or object remains touched by your chaos until:

-   Its chaos duration expires. The chaos duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   It leaves your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   It uses its action to make a Wisdom ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer touched by your chaos.

### Chaos Burn

At level 3, your chaos starts undoing reality. Whenever you gain chaos points, you and things touched by your chaos each take force damage equal to your chaos points minus your max spell points, minimum of 0.

### Chaos Modifier

At level 3, your chaos effects your ability to cast effective spells. While you have chaos points, your spellcasting ability modifier is changed to your chaos points divided by 5, rounded up.

### Luck Warping

At level 5, outcomes are randomly changed in unexpected ways. Whenever a d20 is rolled, if it is rolled by you or an effect or creature that is touched by your chaos, its value is warped. If the result is odd, you add your chaos points to it. If the result is even, you subtract your chaos points from it. The result may go above 20 or below 0.

### Origin Shifting

At level 7, the points of origin shift around you in unnatural ways. The origin point of spells and attacks touched by your chaos shift in your shifting direction. Your shifting direction gets set to your current facing direction whenever you cast a Chaotic spell. Origin points continually shift in this direction by an amount equal to your chaos points, rounded up to the nearest 5.

When a creature touched by your chaos moves on their turn, they first teleport in your shifting direction, then move from there.

### Lag

At level 11, time starts moving at random speeds. At the start of its turn, a creature touched by your chaos must make a Constitution ability check, with a DC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, max 10. If it gets below the DC, its turn is skipped. If it gets 20 minus the DC or above, it gets to take 2 actions this turn.

### Unstable

At level 15, spells become unpredictable. When a spell is cast, if it is touched by your chaos, it has all numbers in its stats and description increased by your chaos points.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Area Creation

At level 3, you gain affinity for area of effect spells. As a bonus action, you may target an existing area of effect spell in your bonded schools, and increase its radius by 5ft or its diameter by 10ft. Alternatively, you can decrease its radius or diameter by the same amount.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Wide: Double the effect radius and/or diameter of this spell cast, if it has an area of effect.

### Home Advantage

At level 5, you can begin to call your area your home. While standing within one of your Permanent spells, you gain 1 spell point at the start of each of your turns.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Permanent: Infinitize your Tether Range and Spell Duration for this spell cast, and double the spell point cost of this spell cast.

### Area Fixation

At level 7, your Permanent spells prevent other area of effect spells from effecting its area, unless that other spell is also Permanent.

### Area Manipulation

At level 11, you become adept at manipulating areas. Permanent spells you cast in your bonded schools can have 2 Bond Affinity options applied to them.

### Area Admin

At level 15, you gain advanced control over who can access your areas.

As an action, you may choose a creature outside all your Permanent spells. That creature takes 10d10 force damage per round while they’re in any of your Permanent spells. This effect lasts until that creature is no longer in your Tether Range or it lasts longer than your Spell Duration.

As an action, you may choose a creature inside one of your Permanent spells. That creature takes 10d10 force damage per round while they’re outside any of your Permanent spells such that they are no longer in any of your Permanent spells. This effect lasts until that creature is no longer in your Tether Range or it lasts longer than your Spell Duration.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be.

### Halt

At level 3, you learn how to stop reality from breaking. As an action, you can dismiss any spell effect from your bonded schools even if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect. The spell effect must be within your Cast Range.

### Prevention

At level 5, you learn how to prevent reality from being broken. As a reaction, you can counter any spell from your bonded schools. Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

### Vindication

At level 7, you learn how to absorb spells. When you use Halt or Prevention on a spell, you gain spell points equal to the effected spell’s level.

### Restoration

At level 11, you learn how to undo spells. As an action, you may undo the effects of any spell from your bonded schools. The spell must be within Cast Range and must have been cast no longer ago than your Spell Duration.

### Perfection

At level 15, you can stop imperfections from forming. As an action, you can create an anti-spell field at any point within your Cast Range. The anti-spell field has a radius up to your Cast Range and a duration equal to your Spell Duration. The anti-spell field causes any spell from your bonded schools that is cast in it or that overlaps with it to fail.

As an action, you may dismiss an anti-spell field that is within your Cast Range.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Affinity Assist

At level 3, you gain the ability to help others bend reality. When another creature casts a spell from your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to add one of your Bond Affinity options to it. You can do this even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it. Either the casting creature or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Bent: Modify this spell cast’s attributes to your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration.

### Spell Sharing

At level 5, you can give someone else a piece of your power. As an action, you can share a spell you know from your bonded schools with another willing creature within your Cast Range. That creature becomes a vessel of your power, and gains the ability to cast the shared spell, expending your spell points when they do.

When you share a spell, you may choose a Bond Affinity option to apply to the spell whenever the vessel casts it. You can choose the same Bond Affinity option for multiple shared spells.

While a vessel has a spell, you cannot cast that spell or share it. You can have any number of vessels active at the same time, up to the number of spells you know. You can share multiple spells with the same vessel.

A shared spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration, but the ranges use the vessel’s position. A shared spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack modifiers, if applicable. If a shared spell requires concentration, it uses the concentration of the vessel. Every other reference to “you” or “self” in the shared spell refers to the vessel. A vessel gains the benefits of your spellcasting focus when casting a shared spell.

Spells shared with vessels don’t stay shared forever. A shared spell automatically returns to you if any of the following happens:

-   The share duration for the spell expires. A shared spell’s share duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   The vessel becomes outside your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   The vessel dies or ceases to exist.

As an action, you may refresh a vessel’s spells, refreshing the share duration of all spells shared with them, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

As an action, you may take back any number of spells from a vessel, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

When a vessel no longer has any of your shared spells, they are no longer considered a vessel.

### Vessel Casting

At level 5, you can cast spells from your vessels. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Proxied: Cast this spell from a vessel, using their position for this spell cast’s Cast Range and Tether Range.

### Vessel Network

At level 7, you can see from your vessels’ points of view. Any position that is within Tether Range of a vessel is considered to be within Tether Range of you.

You may use your Reality Observer and Affinity Assist features on spells that a vessel sees.

### Worship

At level 11, your power grows the more your name is said. A vessel may use its bonus action to say your name, granting you spell points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

A vessel may spend 1 minute to praise you, granting you spell points equal to your spellcasting ability score.

Once a vessel uses this feature, they can’t do so again until they finish a short or long rest.

### Unity

At level 15, you can unify your vessels in casting a spell. Whenever you cast a spell from your bonded schools, each of your vessels may use their reaction to cast the same spell you cast at the same level, with the same Bond Affinity option.

## Self-Shaper

You are a self-made person, literally. You modified your being and can modify it to your liking.

### Shape Self

At level 3, you can modify yourself daily. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may make a permanent change to yourself:

-   Immunity. Gain immunity to a damage type. This lasts until you use this option again.
-   Skill. Gain proficiency in a skill by losing proficiency in a skill you’re proficient in.
-   Expertise. Gain expertise in a skill you’re proficient in by losing expertise in another skill you’re proficient in.
-   Alignment. Change your alignment.
-   Ability (Level 5). Increase an ability score by up to your spellcasting ability modifier, by decreasing another ability score by the same amount. This feature allows an ability score to go above 20, but not above 30.
-   Bonded Schools (Level 7). Switch out one of your bonded schools for a different school that you don’t know. You still remember spells from your old bonded school, but can’t cast any spells you know from that school or use your Reality Observer feature to learn new spells in that school.

### Unfaltering

At level 5, whenever you roll for an ability check or saving throw, you may add your spellcasting ability modifier to it.

## Luck Bender

Fortune favors you and bends to your will.

### Luck Bend

At level 3, your spells are lucky. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Lucky: Reroll all dice rolls for this spell cast, and then choose which roll to use.

### Lucky

### Willful

At level 7, reality bends to your will. The spell save DC and spell attack modifier of spells you cast are increased by your spellcasting ability modifier an additional time.

### Fortunate

### Plot Armor

### Dictation

At level 20, you have mastered fortune. As a reaction, you can set any number of rolled dice to any value possible for that die. This effect then lasts until the end of the turn.

## Item Infuser

You don’t like casting spells directly, and instead prefer to infuse items with your power, and cast spells through them.

### Infusing

At level 3, you gain the ability to infuse an item with a spell.

You may spend 1 hour or more infusing an item you’re holding with a spell from your bonded schools. The spell costs double the amount of spell points it normally would. Make an ability check in your spellcasting ability. The DC equals the spell’s casted level times 2, plus 10, minus the number of hours you spend infusing it. You may spend extra spell points to decrease this DC by 1 per extra spell point spent. On a success, the item is infused with the spell. On a failure, the spell points are still spent, but the item is not infused with the spell.

Once complete, the item can be activated to cast the infused spell. The infused spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration at the time of infusion, but its Cast Range and Tether Range use the item’s position instead of your position. The infused spell always uses the Bond Affinity option applied to it when it was infused.

An infused item has a limited number of charges of a spell. It regains all charges at dawn each day. As you level up, the amount of charges you can infuse into an item also increases, as shown in the following table:

| Level | Charges |
|-------|---------|
| 3     | 1       |
| 5     | 2       |
| 7     | 3       |
| 11    | 4       |
| 15    | 5       |

An item can only be infused with one spell at a time. If you infuse an infused item with another spell, the new spell overwrites the old spell.

Infused items are infused permanently. They don’t lose their infusion when they leave your Tether Range, and they don’t expire after your Spell Duration.

### Item Upgrading

At level 5, you can upgrade infused items you’re previously infused. While holding the infused item, you can spend 1 hour and a number of spell points equal to the infused spell’s level to upgrade the infused spell’s Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration to be equal to yours. When you do this, you may choose to replace the spell’s Bond Affinity option with another Bond Affinity option that you know.

### Item Location

At level 5, you learn how to locate items you infused. If an item is within your Tether Range, or if it was infused or upgraded recently within your Spell Duration, you can automatically sense its exact location.

If you cannot sense its exact location, you can try to sense its direction. As an action, you can make an ability check in your spellcasting ability at advantage. The DC is at your DM’s discretion, preferably 15 or more, depending on how far outside your Tether Range it is, and how long ago past your Spell Duration it was infused or upgraded. On a success, you know in which direction the item is.

### Remote Sense

At level 7, you gain senses from your infused items.

You can sense the surroundings of an infused item. As an action, you may choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You can then sense how many items, walls, creatures, etc. are in its vicinity, and their exact locations, but you can’t sense what kind of thing they are. This sense lasts until the beginning of your next turn. If the infused item is not in that exact location, this action fails.

### Remote Activation

At level 7, you can remotely activate items you infuse. As a bonus action, you may choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You then activate that item. If you can see or have senses of the infused item’s surroundings, you can choose the targets. Otherwise, the infused item automatically targets the closest valid target or area. If the infused item is not in that exact location, this bonus action fails.

### Auto-Activation

At level 11, you learn how to cause an item to react to a situation. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Reactive: Set a reactive condition for this spell cast, which automatically activates this spell cast’s infused item when met.

### Multi-Infusing

At level 15, you learn how to cram more spells into a single item. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Appended: Infuse this spell cast into an infused item without overwriting spells already infused into it.

When an item with multiple infused spells is activated, each spell is activated all in the same turn, in order of infusion, using the same targets, if applicable.
