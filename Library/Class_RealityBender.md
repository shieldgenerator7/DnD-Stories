# Class Features

2023-08-09: copied from http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wizard

## Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d6 per level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per level after 1st

## Proficiencies

Armor: None

Weapons: None

Tools: None

Saving Throws: Choose two from Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma

Skills: Arcana and one other skill that uses your chosen spellcasting ability

## Equipment

This class grants you no additional starting equipment.

# Spellcasting

You are a spellcaster whose only limitation is your own imagination.

## Bonded Schools

Choose a school of magic as your bonded school. You bond to more schools as you level up, as shown in the class table. You get special bonuses when casting spells in your bonded schools. This class only grants you the ability to learn and cast spells from your bonded schools.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus. This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require, even if the spell normally consumes the material components.

## Casting Spells

The class table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell points equal to the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells that you cast from your bonded schools have their attributes changed. If the spell has a range greater than Touch or Self, its casting range is changed to your Cast Range based on your level as shown in the class table. Spells that have a duration longer than Instantaneous also have their duration changed to your Spell Duration based on your level as shown in the class table. These spells also have a new stat called Tether Range. If the spell’s center of effect ever becomes further away from you than the tether range, then the spell ends automatically.

## Dispelling Spells

As an action, you may dispel any ongoing spell that you have cast.

## Spellcasting Ability

Choose an ability among Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. This will be your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use this chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

## Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

At level 1, you know 1 cantrip and 1 1st-level spell, both from your bonded school. As you level up, the minimum amount of spells you know of 1st level is equal to your level. When you level up, you may learn one 1st-level spell from your bonded schools.

You learn additional cantrips and spells as you adventure in the world, using your Reality Observer feature.

## Starting with Spells

When you’re starting a new campaign at 1st level or higher, you may have already seen a few spells in your bonded schools. For each spell you think you might know, you may roll an ability check in your spellcasting ability to see if you’ve seen the spell be cast before, or have imagined it before. The DC is equal to the spell’s level times 2, plus 10, plus the spell’s level times the number of spells you already know of the same level, minus your level in this class. For cantrips, the DC is equal to 10 plus the number of cantrips you know, minus your level in this class. Your DM may modify this DC at their discretion. On a success, you know the spell. On a failure, you don’t know the spell before starting the campaign, but you can still learn it during the campaign.

Here is another way of writing the same DCs:

Cantrip Seen DC = 10 + number of cantrips you know – your level  
`10 + cantripCount - classLevel`

Spell Seen DC = 10 + (spell’s level \* 2) + (spell’s level \* number of spells you know at that level) – your level  
`10 + (spellLevel * 2) + (spellLevel * spellCount[spellLevel]) + classLevel`

Using this feature, it’s possible to have learned a 9th level spell at level 1, not that you necessarily have the means to cast it. For this reason, it’s imperative that you discuss this feature with your DM and approve any spells you gain at the start of the campaign with this feature. For example, your DM may apply a level restriction, such as only allowing spells of 3rd level or lower. Or they might raise or lower the DC, or put a limit on how many total spells you can attempt to gain with this check or how many you can actually learn in total. This feature, as written, imposes no such limitations by default. Any and all limitations are up to your DM to decide.

# Reality Observer

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. At level 1, whenever you see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to automatically learn that spell, no matter what level it is. However, you must finish a long rest before you are able to first cast the new spell.

# Bond Affinity

At level 2, you gain affinity for spells in your bonded schools, getting bonuses when casting these spells. When you cast a spell in your bonded schools, you may spend extra spell points to choose a Bond Affinity option that you learned to apply to it:

-   Powerful: 2 Spell Points. Roll 2 extra dice whenever you would roll dice for this spell cast.
-   Replenishing: 2 Spell Points. Regain spell points equal to this spell’s base level plus one after casting this spell.
-   Quick: 1 Spell Point. Cast this spell as a bonus action, if the spell’s cast time is 1 action.
-   Reactive: 2 Spell Points. Cast this spell as a reaction, if the spell’s cast time is 1 action or 1 bonus action.
-   Hasty: 1 Spell Point. Cast this spell as an action, if the spell’s cast time is 1 minute.
-   Capital: 2 Spell Points. Upcast this spell by the amount of levels it is already being upcast by.
-   Animating: 1 Spell Point. Cast this spell without requiring concentration.
-   Focused: 2 Spell Points. Add your spellcasting ability modifier to the spellcasting ability modifier used by this spell cast.
-   Reaching: 2 Spell Points. Increase this spell’s cast range by your Cast Range.
-   Remote: 2 Spell Points. Increase this spell’s tether range by your Tether Range.
-   Lasting: 2 Spell Points. Increase this spell’s spell duration by your Spell Duration.

You learn one Bond Affinity option at level 1. You gain Bond Affinity options as you level up, as shown in the class table. You may not unlearn a Bond Affinity option, and when you may learn a new Bond Affinity option, you may not replace a Bond Affinity option you already learned.

Bending Styles may also grant you extra Bond Affinity options. These do not count against the total Bond Affinity options that you know as shown in the class table.

# Arcane Skill

At level 3, you can channel your magic into all your endeavors. Whenever you make an ability check, you may spend spell points to decrease the DC by 1 per spell point spent.

# Bending Style

At level 3, you choose a Bending Style, as listed below. The Bending Style you choose will give you features at levels 3, 5, 7, 11, and 15. They will also grant you bonus Bond Affinity options.

-   Reality Breaker
-   Reality Forger
-   Reality Fixer
-   Reality Sharer
-   Self-Shaper
-   Luck Bender
-   Item Infuser
-   Battle Bender
-   Far Watcher
-   Dreamer

# Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can do one of three things:

-   Increase one ability score of your choice by 2, max 20.
-   Increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, max 20.
-   Increase your spellcasting ability score by 1, max 30.

# Bending Trick

At level 5, you learn a little trick you can use on a daily basis. Choose one of your bonded schools, and then choose to learn a bending trick appropriate for that school:

-   Trinket (Conjuration): Create an object that fits inside a 1ft cube.
-   Summon (Conjuration): Choose a creature or object within your Tether Range or that you have seen within your Spell Duration, and teleport them to any open space within 30ft of you.
-   Intuition (Divination): Ask the DM a question about something within your Cast Range or happened within your Spell Duration, and they will answer “yes” or “no”, or if the answer isn’t clear-cut, “maybe”.
-   Step in Shoes (Divination): Choose a creature you can see within range. You become blind to your own senses and instead sense everything from that creature’s senses, including senses you yourself don’t have.
-   Block (Abjuration): As a reaction, block all damage that would be dealt to you until the end of the turn. Not bound to Spell Duration.
-   Tether (Abjuration): As a bonus action, choose a creature within Cast Range, and a point or object within Cast Range. That creature can’t move more than 30ft from the point or object by nonmagical means. If the creature manages to get 35ft or more from the point or object, this effect ends early.
-   Opine (Enchantment): State your opinion, and all creatures within Cast Range that can receive your communication and know the language must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they agree with your opinion unquestionably.
-   Sway (Enchantment): Choose a creature within Cast Range. They must make a Charisma saving throw, and on a failure, you get to decide what bonus action they take on their next turn.
-   Materialmorph (Transmutation): Choose an object within Cast Range and that can fit into a 1ft cube. It becomes a material of your choosing, gaining the stats and effects of that new material.
-   Petmorph (Transmutation): Choose a creature within Cast Range and that can fit into a 1ft cube. It becomes another creature of your choice that can also fit into a 1ft cube.
-   Disguise (Illusion): Change your appearance, your voice, and your smell.
-   Hallucination (Illusion): A target creature sees what you want them to see. You can also make them not see something that is there. The creature can make an Intelligence check, and on a success, discern that the hallucinations aren’t real.
-   Stasis (Evocation): Choose a creature. That creature can’t move or take actions, bonus actions, or reactions. They are immune to all damage and can’t be targeted or effected by any spell. If they are unconscious, they don’t make death saves but also can’t be stabilized.
-   Energy Blast (Evocation): Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within Cast Range. On a hit, the creature takes 1d12 damage with a damage type of your choice: cold, fire, acid, lightning, thunder.
-   Wake (Necromancy): Choose a creature within your Cast Range that died within your Spell Duration. They get up with 10 temporary hit points. They can move and attack like normal but can’t cast spells. If they make death saving throws, they do so at advantage. If they die for good or stabilize, this effect ends early.
-   Necrofy (Necromancy): Choose a creature within Cast Range. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it becomes weak to necrotic damage, and takes an extra 1d4 necrotic damage whenever it takes other types of damage.

You can learn an additional bending trick at levels 6, 10, 14, 17, 18, and 20. You may not learn a bending trick more than once, and you may not replace a bending trick you know with a new bending trick.

Bending tricks, unless stated otherwise, are bound by both your Tether Range and Spell Duration. Unless stated otherwise, they require an action to activate. You may manually end any bending trick as an action.

Once you use a bending trick, you can’t use that bending trick again until you finish a short rest.

# Reality Studier

At level 7, you can more easily absorb information about spells. As an action, you may use your Reality Observer feature on an ongoing spell effect.

As an action, you can study an ongoing spell effect. While looking at a spell effect that you used Reality Observer on within the past minute, you can use your action to make an ability check in your spellcasting ability. The DC is equal to 20 plus the spell’s casted level. On a success, you figure out how to cast the spell and can cast the new spell without having to complete a long rest. On a failure, you don’t figure out the spell. Either way, you regain 1 spell point.

# Rejuvenation

At level 9, when you cast a spell from your bonded schools, you heal for the number of spell points spent to cast it.

# Arcane Survival

At level 9, you can channel your magic into keeping yourself safe. Whenever you must make a saving throw, you can spend spell points to decrease the DC by 1 per spell point spent.

# Free Modding

At level 10, you figure out how to freely modify your spells. Whenever you add a Bond Affinity option to a spell, you may apply any number of additional Bond Affinity options to it, as long as you can pay the extra spell point cost.

# Energy Store

At level 11, when you use an action to dispel a spell you cast, you gain back spell points equal to the spell’s printed level.

# Recasting

At level 13, when one of your spells ends, you sense it, and may use your reaction to recast the spell on the same target(s), using the same Bond Affinity option.

# Refill

At level 15, you can replenish your spell points. As a bonus action, regain spell points equal to your current health. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Reality Command

At level 20, you can rally your energy into one big spell. When you add two or more Bond Affinity options to a spell, you may choose to ignore the spell point cost of the Bond Affinity options, and pay only the spell’s spell point cost.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

# Bending Styles

At level 3, you choose a Bending Style.

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

### Chaos Buildup

At level 3, you start losing control of your abilities. You gain chaos points at an alarming rate, that builds up overtime, with no maximum value. As you level up, the rate increases.

| Level | Chaos Buildup Rate |
|-------|--------------------|
| 3     | 1/day              |
| 5     | 1/hour             |
| 7     | 1/minute           |
| 11    | 1/round            |
| 15    | 10/round           |

Additionally, whenever you or a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell from your bonded schools, you gain chaos points equal to that spell’s base level.

### Chaos Release

At level 3, you can let out your chaotic urges. Whenever you gain chaos points, you may use your reaction to cast a spell you know from your bonded schools.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Chaotic: Spend chaos points for this spell cast instead of spell points. Touch this spell cast with your chaos, also touching creatures effected by this spell cast with your chaos.

You don’t gain chaos points from casting a Chaotic spell.

### Chaos Spread

At level 3, you can’t contain your chaos as it spreads.

When a creature touched by your chaos casts a spell or makes an attack, that spell or attack is also touched by your chaos. A spell that is touched by your chaos causes everything it targets or in its area of effect to also be touched by your chaos. An attack that is touched by your chaos causes its target to also be touched by your chaos, if it hits.

A creature and/or object remains touched by your chaos until:

-   Its chaos duration expires. The chaos duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   It leaves your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   It uses its action to make a Wisdom ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer touched by your chaos.

### Chaos Burn

At level 3, your chaos starts undoing reality. Whenever you gain chaos points, you and things touched by your chaos each take force damage equal to your chaos points minus your max spell points, minimum of 0.

### Chaos Modifier

At level 3, your chaos effects your ability to cast effective spells. While you have chaos points, your spellcasting ability modifier is changed to your chaos points divided by 5, rounded up.

### Luck Warping

At level 5, outcomes are randomly changed in unexpected ways. Whenever a d20 is rolled, if it is rolled by you or an effect or creature that is touched by your chaos, its value is warped. If the result is odd, you add your chaos points to it. If the result is even, you subtract your chaos points from it. The result may go above 20 or below 0.

### Origin Shifting

At level 7, the points of origin shift around you in unnatural ways. The origin point of spells and attacks touched by your chaos shift in your shifting direction. Your shifting direction gets set to your current facing direction whenever you cast a Chaotic spell. Origin points continually shift in this direction by an amount equal to your chaos points, rounded up to the nearest 5.

When a creature touched by your chaos moves on their turn, they first teleport in your shifting direction, then move from there.

### Lag

At level 11, time starts moving at random speeds. At the start of its turn, a creature touched by your chaos must make a Constitution ability check, with a DC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, max 10. If it gets below the DC, its turn is skipped. If it gets 20 minus the DC or above, it gets to take 2 actions this turn.

### Unstable

At level 15, spells become unpredictable. When a spell is cast, if it is touched by your chaos, it has all numbers in its stats and description increased by your chaos points.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Area Creation

At level 3, you gain affinity for area of effect spells. As a bonus action, you may target an existing area of effect spell in your bonded schools, and increase its radius (or diameter) up to an amount depending on your level, as shown in the following chart. Alternatively, you can decrease its radius (or diameter).

|    | Effect Radius Increase | Effect Diameter Increase |
|----|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3  | 5ft                    | 10ft                     |
| 5  | 10ft                   | 20ft                     |
| 7  | 20ft                   | 40ft                     |
| 11 | 50ft                   | 100ft                    |
| 15 | 100ft                  | 200ft                    |

The target spell must be within your Cast Range. The radius can’t exceed the Tether Range of the spell, or go below 0. If the radius gets reduced to 0, the spell ends.

You may use this feature on an area of effect spell that you did not cast, as long as it is in your bonded schools. If the spell doesn’t have a Tether Range, you use your Tether Range for determining the max radius you can expand it to.

### Area Permanence

At level 5, you learn how to make your spells stable long-term.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Permanent: Increase your Tether Range and/or Spell Duration up to infinity for this spell cast, if it has an area of effect.

Permanent spells cost double the spell points to cast, and take twice as long to cast. If the cast time is less than 1 minute, the cast time is increased to 1 minute. Permanent spells don’t require concentration. If a Permanent spell is centered on yourself or another creature, it is instead centered on a point in space. When you use your action to dismiss one of your Permanent spells, you must spend spell points equal to the spell’s casted level to do so.

### Home Advantage

At level 5, you can begin to call your area your home. Each of your Permanent spells contributes to the combined area called your Permanent Area. While standing within your Permanent Area, you gain 1 spell point at the start of each of your turns.

### Area Fixation

At level 7, other area of effect spells have no effect in your Permanent Area, unless that other spell is also Permanent.

### Area Manipulation

At level 11, you become adept at manipulating areas. When you cast a spell with the Permanent Bond Affinity option, you may choose a 2nd Bond Affinity option to apply to it.

### Area Admin

At level 15, you gain advanced control over who can access your areas.

As an action, you may choose a creature that is within your Cast Range and outside your Permanent Area to mark as Banned. At the start of a Banned creature’s turn, if it’s inside your Permanent Area, that creature takes up to 10d10 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced 5ft toward the closest square not in your Permanent Area. This effect also happens the first time the creature enters your Permanent Area on its turn.

As an action, you may choose a creature that is within your Cast Range and inside your Permanent Area to mark as Penned. At the start of a Penned creature’s turn, if it’s not inside your Permanent Area, that creature takes up to 10d10 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced 5ft toward the closest square in your Permanent Area. This effect also happens the first time the creature exits your Permanent Area on its turn. If a Penned creature finds itself outside your Permanent Area due to one of your spells being dispelled, its Penned mark is removed.

As an action, you may remove a Banned or Penned mark from a creature.

Each mark is permanent, and you may mark an infinite number of creatures. If you attempt to mark an already-marked creature, the new mark replaces the old mark.

If a creature would take damage from this feature, you may instead reduce that damage to any amount, minimum 0.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be. You believe reality is broken, and certain schools of magic are to blame.

### Bond Disdain

At level 3, you can disrupt others who are casting spells in your bonded schools. Whenever you or another creature casts a spell, you may spend 1 spell point to apply a Bond Disdain option that you learned to it:

-   Costly: Double the amount of spell slots and/or spell points spent to cast this spell.
-   Close: Half this spell’s cast range.
-   Tethered: Add a Tether Range to this spell cast equal to its caster’s walk speed, or if it already has a Tether Range, half it.
-   Short: Half this spell’s duration, if its duration is longer than 1 round. If the duration is 1 round, the spell ends at the end of the turn instead.
-   Unfocused: Half the spellcaster’s spellcasting ability modifier for this spell cast, rounded up.
-   Weak: Half any and all die rolls the spell caster rolls for this spell cast, rounded up.

You learn a Bond Disdain option at level 3, and may learn a new one at levels 5, 7, 11, and 15. You may not unlearn Bond Disdain options, and you may not replace a Bond Disdain option when you learn a new one.

Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range for you to use this feature. You may apply a Bond Disdain option to a spell even if it already has a Bond Affinity and/or Bond Disdain option applied to it.

### Halt

At level 5, you learn how to stop reality from breaking. As an action, you can dismiss any ongoing spell effect from your bonded schools even if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect. The spell effect must be within your Cast Range.

### Prevention

At level 7, you learn how to prevent reality from being broken. As a reaction, you can counter any spell from your bonded schools. Either the caster or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

### Vindication

At level 11, you learn how to absorb spells. When you use Halt or Prevention on a spell, you gain spell points equal to the effected spell’s level.

### Restoration

At level 11, you learn how to undo spells. As an action, you may undo the effects of any spell from your bonded schools. The spell must be within Cast Range and must have been cast no longer ago than your Spell Duration.

### Perfection

At level 15, you can stop imperfections from forming. As an action, you can create an anti-spell field at any point within your Cast Range. The anti-spell field has a radius up to your Cast Range and a duration equal to your Spell Duration. The anti-spell field causes any spell from your bonded schools that is cast in it or that overlaps with it to fail.

As an action, you may dismiss an anti-spell field that is within your Cast Range.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Affinity Assist

At level 3, you gain the ability to help others bend reality. When another creature casts a spell from your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to add one of your Bond Affinity options to it. You can do this even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it. Either the casting creature or the spell must be within your Cast Range.

You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Bent: Modify this spell cast’s attributes to your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration.

### Spell Sharing

At level 5, you can give someone else a piece of your power. As an action, you can share a spell you know from your bonded schools with another willing creature within your Cast Range. That creature becomes a vessel of your power, and gains the ability to cast the shared spell, expending your spell points when they do.

When you share a spell, you may choose a Bond Affinity option to apply to the spell whenever the vessel casts it. You can choose the same Bond Affinity option for multiple shared spells.

While a vessel has a spell, you cannot cast that spell or share it. You can have any number of vessels active at the same time, up to the number of spells you know. You can share multiple spells with the same vessel.

A shared spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration, but the ranges use the vessel’s position. A shared spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack modifiers, if applicable. If a shared spell requires concentration, it uses the concentration of the vessel. Every other reference to “you” or “self” in the shared spell refers to the vessel. A vessel gains the benefits of your spellcasting focus when casting a shared spell.

Spells shared with vessels don’t stay shared forever. A shared spell automatically returns to you if any of the following happens:

-   The share duration for the spell expires. A shared spell’s share duration is equal to your Spell Duration.
-   The vessel becomes outside your Tether Range or shifts to another plane.
-   The vessel dies or ceases to exist.

As an action, you may refresh a vessel’s spells, refreshing the share duration of all spells shared with them, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

As an action, you may take back any number of spells from a vessel, if the vessel is within your Cast Range.

When a vessel no longer has any of your shared spells, they are no longer considered a vessel.

### Vessel Casting

At level 7, you can cast spells from your vessels. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Proxied: Cast this spell from a vessel, using their position for this spell cast’s Cast Range and Tether Range.

### Vessel Network

At level 7, you can see from your vessels’ points of view. Any position that is within Tether Range of a vessel is considered to be within Tether Range of you.

You may use your Reality Observer and Affinity Assist features on spells that a vessel sees.

### Worship

At level 11, your power grows the more your name is said.

At the start of a vessel’s turn, they may say your name, granting you 1 spell point.

### Unity

At level 15, you can unify your vessels in casting a spell. Whenever you cast a spell from your bonded schools, each of your vessels may use their reaction to cast the same spell you cast at the same level, with the same Bond Affinity option.

## Self-Shaper

You are a self-made person, literally. You modified your being and can modify it to your liking.

### Shape Self

At level 3, you can modify yourself daily. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may make a permanent change to yourself:

-   Immunity. Gain immunity to a damage type. This lasts until you use this option again.
-   Skill. Gain proficiency in a skill by losing proficiency in a skill you’re proficient in.
-   Expertise. Gain expertise in a skill you’re proficient in by losing expertise in another skill you’re proficient in.
-   Alignment. Change your alignment.
-   Affinity. Switch out a Bond Affinity option you know with another one.
-   Ability (Level 5). Increase an ability score by up to your spellcasting ability modifier, by decreasing another ability score by the same amount. This feature allows an ability score to go above 20, but not above 30.
-   Bonded Schools (Level 7). Switch out one of your bonded schools for a different school that you don’t know. You still remember spells from your old bonded school, but can’t cast any spells you know from that school or use your Reality Observer feature to learn new spells in that school.
-   Race (Level 11). Change your race. You lose the bonuses from your old race and gain the benefits of your new race. You must have seen the race you switch to at least once.
-   Spell (Level 15). Cast a spell you know from your bonded schools that targets only you. The spell must have a duration longer than Instantaneous or have a range of Self or Touch. The spell costs double the spell points it normally would. Afterwards, you can’t cast this spell normally until you spend a future use of this feature to undo this effect.

What changes are available to you depends on your level.

You may spend a use of this feature to undo the effects of a previous use of this feature.

### Self-Centered

At level 3, you can always include yourself. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Self-Inclusive: Also target yourself with this spell cast if it targets one or more other creatures.

### Unfaltering

At level 5, whenever you roll for an ability check or saving throw, you may add your spellcasting ability modifier to it.

### Quick

At level 7, you can quickly protect yourself from any threat. As a reaction, you can cast a spell that targets you, if that spell normally has a cast time of 1 action or 1 bonus action.

### Selfish

At level 11, you can redirect magic into you. As a reaction, change a spell’s target to yourself, if it is targeting another creature. Regain spell points equal to the spell’s casted level.

### Identity

At level 15, you can modify yourself even more easily. Whenever you cast a spell that targets yourself, you can double the result of any and all rolls for that spell.

## Luck Bender

Fortune favors you and bends to your will.

### Luck Bend

At level 3, your spells are lucky. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Lucky: Reroll all dice rolls for this spell cast, and then choose which roll to use.

### Lucky

At level 5, luck is on your side. Once per turn, whenever a d20 is rolled within your Cast Range, you may have that d20 be rerolled, and then you choose which roll to use.

### Willful

At level 7, reality bends to your will. The spell save DC and spell attack modifier of spells you cast are increased by your spellcasting ability modifier an additional time.

### Fortunate

At level 11, you can hardly fail. You get advantage on all ability checks and saving throws.

### Plot Armor

At level 15, no can hurt you. Whenever you have to make a saving throw, the DC is automatically lowered by your spellcasting ability modifier. Additionally, any attack roll against you has disadvantage.

### Dictation

At level 20, you have mastered fortune. As a reaction, you can set any number of rolled dice to any value possible for that die.

## Item Infuser

You don’t like casting spells directly, and instead prefer to infuse items with your power, and cast spells through them.

### Infusing

At level 3, you gain the ability to infuse an item with a spell.

You may spend 1 hour or more infusing an item you’re holding with a spell from your bonded schools. The spell costs double the amount of spell points it normally would. Make an ability check in your spellcasting ability. The DC equals the spell’s casted level times 2, plus 10, minus the number of hours you spend infusing it. On a success, the item is infused with the spell. On a failure, the spell points are still spent, but the item is not infused with the spell.

Once complete, the item can be activated to cast the infused spell. The infused spell is still bound by your Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration at the time of infusion, but its Cast Range and Tether Range use the item’s position instead of your position. The infused spell always uses the Bond Affinity option applied to it when it was infused. You may instead choose to use a lower value for the Cast Range, Tether Range, and/or Spell Duration.

An infused item has a limited number of charges of a spell. It regains all charges at dawn each day. As you level up, the amount of charges you can infuse into an item also increases, as shown in the following table:

| Level | Charges |
|-------|---------|
| 3     | 1       |
| 5     | 2       |
| 7     | 3       |
| 11    | 4       |
| 15    | 5       |

When you an infuse an item, you may instead choose to infuse a lower number of charges than your level allows.

An item can only be infused with one spell at a time. If you infuse an infused item with another spell, the new spell overwrites the old spell.

Infused items are infused permanently. They don’t lose their infusion when they leave your Tether Range, and they don’t expire after your Spell Duration.

If the infused spell has range of Self, it targets the active user of the item. If the active user changes to another creature during the spell, the target switches to the new active user. If there is no active user, it targets no one, but does not end the spell early.

If the infused spell requires concentration, activating it a second time ends the spell effect of its previous activations. It uses the “concentration” of the item, and not the concentration of the user.

### Item Upgrading

At level 5, you can upgrade infused items you’ve previously infused. While holding the infused item, you can spend 1 hour and a number of spell points equal to the infused spell’s level to upgrade the infused spell’s Cast Range, Tether Range, and Spell Duration to be equal to or less than yours. You can also upgrade or downgrade its number of charges. When you do this, you may choose to replace the spell’s Bond Affinity option with another Bond Affinity option that you know.

### Item Location

At level 5, you learn how to locate items you infused. If an item is within your Tether Range, or if it was infused or upgraded recently within your Spell Duration, you can automatically sense its exact location.

If you cannot sense its exact location, you can try to sense its direction. As an action, you can make an ability check in your spellcasting ability at advantage. The DC is at your DM’s discretion, preferably 15 or more, depending on how far outside your Tether Range it is, and how long ago past your Spell Duration it was infused or upgraded. On a success, you know in which direction the item is.

### Remote Sense

At level 7, you gain senses from your infused items.

You can sense the surroundings of an infused item. As an action, you may choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You can then sense how many items, walls, creatures, etc. are in its vicinity, and their exact locations, but you can’t sense what kind of thing they are. This sense lasts until the beginning of your next turn. If the infused item is not in that exact location, this action fails.

### Remote Activation

At level 7, you can remotely activate items you infuse. As a bonus action, you may choose an item you infused that you know the exact location of. You then activate that item. If you can see or have senses of the infused item’s surroundings, you can choose the targets. Otherwise, the infused item automatically targets the closest valid target or area. If the infused item is not in that exact location, this bonus action fails.

### Auto-Activation

At level 11, you learn how to cause an item to react to a situation. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Reactive: Set a reactive condition for this spell cast, which automatically activates this spell cast’s infused item when met.

### Multi-Infusing

At level 15, you learn how to cram more spells into a single item. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Appended: Infuse this spell cast into an infused item without overwriting spells already infused into it.

When an item with multiple infused spells is activated, each spell is activated all in the same turn, in order of infusion, using the same targets, if applicable.

## Battle Bender

You were made for war, and can bend the tides of battle to your will.

### Weapon Observer

At level 3, you remember every weapon, piece of armor, shield, and piece of equipment you see, as well as their stats.

### Spell Conjuration

At level 3, you can conjure any spell into a piece of equipment. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Formed: Conjure this spell cast into a piece of equipment you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

The Formed spell appears as a spectral shape modeled after the piece of equipment you remembered, but has no special effects, and does not cast the spell’s effects when conjured.

The Formed spell has max hit points and AC equal to its casted level.

A Formed spell is very volatile, and dissipates at the end of your turn if:

-   It has 0 hit points or less.
-   It was conjured longer ago than your Spell Duration.
-   It is outside your Tether Range.
-   It hit the ground or another creature and you are not holding it.
-   It got hit by another creature and you are not holding it.
-   You are asleep, unconscious, or dead.
-   You used your action to dismiss it.

### Weapon Conjuration

At level 3, you can conjure any spell into a weapon. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Weapon-Formed: Conjure this spell cast into a weapon you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

A Weapon-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure a Weapon-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen weapon that you remembered, with the same damage roll and properties, but with force damage as the damage type. Its attack modifier ability is your spellcasting ability, and when it hits, it does extra damage equal to the spell’s casted level and procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on them.

### Formed Spell Proc

At level 3, your Formed spells can cast themselves on a target. When a Formed spell procs this feature on a creature, they must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your spell save DC. On a failure, the Formed spell is cast on the target. Any to-hit rolls in the spell’s description automatically succeed, and the creature automatically fails any Dexterity saving throws in the spell’s description. The spell may only target the single creature, even if the spell description says otherwise.

### Arcane Armor

At level 3, you can protect yourself with your magic reserves. Your AC is increased by the number of spell points you have divided by 5, rounded up.

### Armor Conjuration

At level 5, you learn to protect yourself with your spells. You learn the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Armor-Formed: Conjure this spell cast into a piece of armor you remember and don it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

An Armor -Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure an Armor-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen piece of armor that you remembered, with the same AC bonus, but no movement or ability penalty. You can choose to conjure it on an ally instead of yourself.

Whenever another creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, the Armor-Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on them.

You can only wear one Armor-Formed spell at a time. If you don an Armor-Formed spell while wearing one, the new one replaces the old one, and the old one dissipates. You may wear an Armor-Formed spell over physical armor.

### Shield Conjuration

At level 7, you learn how to conjure shields. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Shield-Formed: Conjure this spell cast into a shield you remember and equip it, if the spell can target one or more creatures.

A Shield-Formed spell counts as a Formed spell and follows the same rules as outlined in your Spell Conjuration feature, but with the special abilities outlined below.

When you conjure a Shield-Formed spell, it comes formed as the chosen shield that you remembered, with the same AC bonus.

Whenever you or an ally within melee range of you is targeted by an attack, you may use your reaction to intercept. You impose disadvantage to the attack roll. If the attack misses, your Shield-Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on the attacking creature, if that creature is within your Casting Range.

### Violent Dismissal

At level 7, you figure out how to exploit the volatile nature of your Formed spells. As an action, you can choose a Formed spell and make it explode. All creatures in a radius equal to your Casting Range and with line of sight of the Formed spell must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to your spell save DC. On a failure, they take damage equal to the Formed spell’s casted level and the Formed spell procs your Formed Spell Proc feature on them. On a success, they take half as much damage and suffer no ill effects.

The Formed spell is destroyed immediately when it explodes.

You may choose a Formed spell even if it is outside your Cast Range or Tether Range.

### Temporary Permanence

At level 11, you work around some limitations of your conjured spells. Formed spells no longer dissipate at the end of your turn due to you not holding them.

### Rigged Conjuration

At level 11, you can get one last use out of your Formed spells. Whenever one or more of your Formed spells would simply dissipate at the end of your turn, you may instead use your reaction to activate your Violent Dismissal feature on any number of your Formed spells about to dissipate.

### Last Word

At level 15, you can react to the death around you.

Whenever you or another creature you can see dies, you may use your reaction to activate your Violent Dismissal feature on any number of your Formed spells.

## Far Watcher

You don’t really want to participate in reality, and prefer to watch it unfold instead.

### Bystander

At level 3, you learn how to keep other people from interacting with you. As an action, you can make yourself invisible. The duration of this effect is equal to your Spell Duration. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.

As an action, you can dismiss this effect.

This effect ends automatically if you attack or cast a spell.

### Unseen Casting

At level 3, you learn how to keep your spells from giving you away. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Invisible: Make this spell cast and its effects invisible. Casting this spell doesn’t end invisibility effects.

An Invisible spell can’t be seen by anyone but you. An Invisible spell will not give away your location or inform other creatures that it was you who cast it, nor will it end the Bystander effect. An Invisible spell that mentions you in the description instead mentions nobody.

### Safe

At level 5, you learn how to make yourself less vulnerable. Whenever you use your Bystander feature, you can make yourself ethereal in addition to or instead of invisible. While you’re ethereal:

-   You can pass through walls.
-   You are untargetable and immune to all damage types.
-   Your spells and attacks deal 0 damage.

### Watch Together

At level 7, you can bring guests into your world. When you expend a use of another feature, you can use a copy of it on another creature within your Cast Range in addition to yourself.

This feature includes your Far Watcher Bending Style features:

-   Bystander (& Safe)
-   Predictive
-   Removed from Reality

### Predictive

At level 11, you get good at predicting outcomes. Whenever you cast a spell, you can choose to simulate it instead. Process the spell like normal. If you like the outcome of the spell, you can commit it to reality and the game continues as normal. If you don’t like the outcome of the spell, you can revert all changes the spell made, and the game continues as if you had not cast that spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.

### Removed from Reality

At level 15, you learn how to change the channel. As an action, you can shift to another plane of existence. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.

## Dreamer

Your dreams have a strange way of effecting reality. When you go to sleep, you cast spells and do things you’d do in a dream. But when you wake up, you realize that the things that happened in your dreams happened for real.

### Sleep Walking

At level 3, your mind wanders the plane, conjuring a version of you. Whenever you fall asleep, your dream self appears as an illusion of you within Cast Range of the last person, place, or thing you thought of when going to sleep.

You can see, hear, and sense from your dream self, and you have full control over your dream self. Your dream self is tangible and can interact with objects. You can cast spells from your dream self, using your dream self’s position for the Cast Range and Tether Range.

Your dream self has all your stats and takes damage as normal. If your dream self dies or drops to 0 hit points, it disappears and you wake up. You can’t go back to sleep for at least 10 minutes.

If your dream self becomes further than your Tether Range from your dream target, your current dream ends. When your dream self is near your dream target for longer than your Spell Duration, your current dream ends. When your current dream ends, your dream self disappears and you are no longer dreaming.

When a dream ends, you must make a DC15 ability check in your spellcasting ability. On a success, you remember everything that happened in the dream. On a failure, you forget everything that happened in the dream, but can remember one detail about a place you went to, a person you met, or a creature and/or object you saw.

When you’re not dreaming, you see only blackness and you don’t perceive time.

While you’re not dreaming, you may begin a new dream at any time. You can have a number of dreams per long rest equal to your level in this class divided by 2, minimum of 2. When you begin a new dream, you may choose a new dream target. You must choose a different dream target for each dream in a long rest.

### Dream Variance

At level 3, your dreams can take on a mind of their own. You get a d20, which is called your Dream Die. When a dream begins, roll your Dream Die. The value of your Dream Die determines what kind of dream you’re having:

-   1-5: Nightmare. Add your proficiency bonus to the damage your dream self takes, and the spell point cost of spells your dream self casts. Subtract your proficiency bonus from the damage your dream self deals, and the result of saving throws and ability checks your dream self makes.
-   6-9: Doozy. Subtract your proficiency bonus from the result of saving throws and ability checks your dream self makes.
-   10-11: Neutral. Nothing is changed.
-   12-15: Pleasant Jaunt. Add your proficiency bonus to the result of saving throws and ability checks your dream self makes.
-   16-20: Dream Dream. Subtract your proficiency bonus from the damage your dream self takes, and the spell point cost of spells your dream self casts. Add your proficiency bonus to the damage your dream self deals, and the result of saving throws and ability checks your dream self makes.

Your Dream Die value can range from 1 to 20.

After your dream self takes damage, make a DC 15 saving throw in your spellcasting ability. On a failure, reduce your Dream Die’s value by 1.

After your dream self casts a spell, you may make a DC 10 ability check in your spellcasting ability. On a success, increase your Dream Die’s value by 1.

### Stasis

At level 5, your dreams protect you. Whenever you go to sleep, and at the start of each of your turns while sleeping, you gain temporary hit points equal to the value of your Dream Die. When you wake up, you lose these temporary hit points.

### Dream Logic

At level 5, your dream self can teleport. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Dream Logic: Teleport your dream self to a space in range and then cast this spell from that new location. The range is equal to 5 times the sum of the spell points spent to cast this spell and the value of your Dream Die.

Whenever your dream self would fall or otherwise be forced to move, you may make an ability check in your spellcasting ability instead. On a success, your dream self doesn’t fall or get moved forcefully, becoming ethereal if necessary to avoid sharing a space with another creature or object. It becomes solid again when it is no longer sharing a space with that creature or object. On a failure, your dream self falls or gets moved forcefully like normal.

### Dream Lucidity

At level 7, you gain better control over your dreams. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Lucid Dreaming: This spell cast refreshes the duration of your current dream and increases the value of your Dream Die by 1.

As an action, you may end the current dream.

Whenever a dream ends, you regain spell points equal to the value of your Dream Die.

### Sleep Form

At level 7, you’re unbound from your physical form. When you enter a new dream, your dream self can appear as any creature you’ve seen before. It still has your stats and abilities. It gains 1 feature of the chosen creature, and can use that feature once per dream.

### Location Shift

At level 11, you can change locations. When you use your action to end the current dream, and start a new dream immediately, you can bring any number of other people, things, and/or creatures within your Cast Range with you to the new dream. If a new dream doesn’t begin immediately, this feature has no effect.

Creatures and objects you bring with you teleport to an unoccupied space within your Cast Range at the new location. If there’s not a valid location for a creature or object to land in, it doesn’t get brought through.

You can use this feature once per long rest.

### Just a Dream

At level 15, you can fight nightmares. You can end a dream as a reaction. When you end a dream, you can undo one negative event that happened in that dream:

-   The death of a player, NPC, or pet. They come back to life with an amount of hit points equal to the value of your Dream Die.
-   The destruction of an item.
-   The casting of a specific spell that was cast within the last round.
-   An action or bonus action that another creature took within the last round.

### Not a Dream!

At level 15, you can wake up in your dream. When a dream ends, you can choose to wake up. When you wake up from a dream, you can choose to teleport to your dream self’s last location.
