## Equipment

# Spellcasting

Choose two schools of magic as your bonded schools. You get special bonuses when casting spells in your bonded schools as you level up.

## Spellcasting Focus

Choose a body part as your spell casting focus. This body part can be used as your spell casting focus for spells in your bonded schools, allowing you to cast those spells without the verbal, somatic, or material components they would normally require.

## Cantrips

At level 1, choose three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the class table.

## Preparing and Casting Spells

The class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells from the spells you know equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're level 3, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

## Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Ritual Casting

You can cast a spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

## Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a level, you can add two spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the class table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can learn.

# Reality Observer

Your spells are only limited by your imagination. At level 1, whenever you see another creature cast a spell in your bonded schools, you automatically learn that spell, even if you don’t have spell slots for it.

# Bond Affinity

At level 1, you gain affinity for spells in your two bonded schools. You can use this feature to gain bonuses when casting these spells. When you cast a spell in your bonded schools, you can choose one bond affinity option to apply to it. You gain bond affinity options as you level up, starting with this option:

-   Power up: You can add your proficiency bonus 1 additional time to this spell cast’s spell save DC and/or spell attack modifier.

# Reality Bender

At level 3, you gain the following option for your Bond Affinity:

-   Conserving: You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot, as long as the spell isn’t being upcast.

# Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

# Reality Warper

At level 6, you gain the following option for your Bond Affinity:

-   Quick: You can cast this spell as a bonus action, as long as the spell’s cast time is 1 action.

# Reality Shaper

At level 7, when you cast a spell in your bonded schools, spells you cast last longer.

# Reality Seer

At level 8, when you cast a spell in your bonded schools, spells you cast have longer cast range.

# Reality Winder

At level 9, you gain the following option for your Bond Affinity:

-   Winding: You cast this spell as if it didn’t have concentration.

# Subclasses

At level 3, you choose a subclass.

## Reality Breaker

You bend reality so much that things stop making sense.

### Reality Burner

At level 3, you gain increased ability to do damage. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Damaging: Whenever this spell deals damage, double the amount of damage this spell deals.

### Reality Spreader

At level 7, you gain the ability to increase your effects. You gain the following Bond Affinity option:

-   Spreading: If this spell targets 1 or more creatures and/or objects, double the number of targets.

### Broken

At level 11, you start losing control of your abilities. Whenever damage is dealt to any creature in range, you gain chaos points equal to the damage dealt. When you gain 100 or more chaos points, you may use your reaction to gain a temporary spell slot with a level equal to the number of chaos points divided by 100, rounded down. As part of this same reaction, you may cast a spell from your bonded schools using the temporary spell slot.

If you gain more than 1 temporary spell slots, you take damage equal to their total combined levels.

If you gain 1000 or more chaos points, you take damage equal to the number of chaos points you have.

## Reality Forger

You seek to build a new environment that is to your liking.

### Area Creation

At level 3, spells you cast in your bonded schools that target an area have an infinite duration, as long as the spell has a duration longer than Instant.

## Reality Fixer

You fix reality to the way you believe it is originally meant to be.

### Cure

At level 3, you learn how to fix reality. As an action, you can dismiss any spell effect from your bonded schools even if you didn’t cast the spell that created the effect.

### Prevention

At level 7, you learn how to prevent reality from being broken. As a reaction, you can counter any spell within range from your bonded schools.

### Restoration

At level 11, you learn how to absorb spells. When you use Cure or Prevention on a spell, you gain a spell slot of that effected spell’s level, even if it’s not a spell slot you normally have.

## Reality Sharer

You want to help other people create their own realities.

### Sharing

At level 3, you can give someone else a piece of your power. As an action, you can target another willing creature you can see within range to gain a spell you know from your bonded schools. That creature gains the ability to cast the spell as if you were casting it, expending your spell slots when they do. While this spell is shared, you cannot cast it. As an action, you may take back this power as long as you can see the creature you gave it to and they are within range.

### Caring

At level 7, you gain the ability to help others bend reality. When another creature in range casts a spell that you know from your bonded schools, you may use your reaction to add one of your Bond Affinity options to it. You can do this even if a Bond Affinity option has already been applied to it.

### Bonding

At level 11, you can bond your spells with others. Whenever you cast a spell from your bonded schools, each creature that has a piece of your power may use its reaction to cast the same spell you cast at the same level, with the same Bond Affinity option.
