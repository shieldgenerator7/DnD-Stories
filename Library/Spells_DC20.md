# Anti-Death Field

8th-level Abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 45ft (15-foot-radius circle)

Components: V, S, M (a small piece of adamantine worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 15 ft radius circle appears at a point you can see within range. For the duration, it prevents creatures inside it from dying. Whenever a creature would drop to 0 hp or less, it instead drops to 1 hp. Creatures at 1 hp don’t take damage while in the area.

When a creature takes damage and is prevented from dropping to 0 hp with this effect, they must make a Constitution saving throw, with a DC equal to 10 or the damage dealt, whichever is higher. When you cast this spell, you may choose to add or subtract your spell casting ability modifier to this DC. On a success, the creature instead drops to 1 hp and stays conscious. On a failure, the creature drops to 1 hp but falls unconscious.

If you take damage while inside the area, the effect takes precedence over rolling for concentration.

# Cringe Reminiscence

3rd-level Enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V

Duration: 1 minute

You admonish a creature you can see within range, causing them to relive a painful memory from their youth. Perhaps the time they farted in front of their crush, the time they entered the wrong house by mistake, or the time they forgot the name of an acquaintance.

The creature must make a Charisma save. On a success, on their next turn, the target must choose between taking their action, bonus action, reaction, or movement; and forfeit the others. On a failure, on each of their turns for the duration of the spell, the target must choose between taking their action, bonus action, reaction, or movement; and forfeit the others.

The creature must be able to hear you and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

5th-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 10 ft

Components: V, S, M (a piece of wool)

Duration: 1 hour

You fog up the eyes of a creature you can see within range.

They gain a bonus to their Stealth checks equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and other creatures that they are unaware of have disadvantage on their Perception checks to detect the creature, and a penalty to Passive Perception equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

The creature is immune to damage from creatures they are unaware of.

When the creature becomes aware of a hostile creature, the spell ends.

# Heart Rend

9th-level Enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 24 hours

You touch a creature and tell them how much they hurt you. They must make a Charisma saving throw. If they have less than 20d10 health, they fail automatically. On a failure, they are overcome with guilt. For the duration, they suffer the following effects:

-   Their movement speed is halved
-   Their AC is decreased by their Agility score modifier
-   They can no longer crit
-   Rolling a 2 on a d20 counts as a fumble for them
-   They must reroll any max value damage dice and use the new value instead
-   All healing they receive is halved
-   They don’t benefit from a short rest or a long rest
-   Whenever they damage you, they must make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take psychic damage equal to the damage they dealt to you times your spellcasting ability modifier.

The creature must be able to hear you and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

The creature can spend 10 minutes to have an open-hearted conversation with you, in which they apologize at least once. If they do, this effect ends early.

As an object interaction, you may sip it to restore 1d4 hp.

The tea is bound to you. If anyone touches the cup, the cup disappears. If the tea is spilled, it vanishes before it hits the ground.

# Death Spotting

1st-level Divination

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: 30ft

Components: V, S

Duration: 24 hours

Up to 3 creatures you can see within range are warded. While they are warded, if they drop to 0 hit points or less, all creatures within 10ft of them take 1d4 radiant damage and are lit up for 1 minute. The creature that last hit the warded creature is lit up for 24 hours. While a creature is lit up, attack rolls against them have advantage, and they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against harmful spell effects.

# Eye Ward

Divination Cantrip

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: 10ft

Components: S

Duration: up to 24 hours

Choose a point within range. You leave behind an ethereal eye that becomes invisible after 1 minute and lasts for the duration. You may use your bonus action to see what it sees and hear what it sees, becoming blind and deaf to your own senses. It has sight and hearing out to a range of 15ft. You may end this effect as a free action. When you do, the eye disappears.

Whenever a creature comes within 15ft of the eye, you get a mental signal telling you that it sensed something. You may then use your reaction to see from the eye as described above.

At higher levels. As you level up, the range of the eye’s senses and auto-detect increase by 15ft at the following levels: level 5 (30ft), level 11 (45ft), level 15 (60ft)
