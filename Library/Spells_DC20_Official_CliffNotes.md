# Find Familiar

Conjuration (Ritual)

Cost: 1 AP + 1 MP

Range: 2 Spaces

Duration: Instant

You summon a friendly spirit that enters your service. It

takes the form of a Tiny creature of your choice, but

with a Creature Type of your choice (except Giant and

Humanoid). Your Familiar uses the statblock below:

AGI 0 INT 0

Recasting the Spell: You can’t have more than 1 Familiar

at a time. If you cast this Spell while you already have a

Familiar, your Familiar can retain its form, adopt a new

form of your choice, or it disappears and a new one takes

its place. The new Familiar can be a previous one you

summoned in the past or a new one altogether. In either

case, you can reassign its Familiar Traits.

Base Familiar Traits

Your Familiar has the following Familiar Traits:

• Familiar Bond: Your Familiar shares your HP and Death’s

Door Threshold. If you both take damage from the same

source, you only take 1 instance of that damage. While

your Familiar occupies the same Space as you, it can’t be

targeted by Attacks.

• Shared Telepathy: While within 20 Spaces, you and your

Familiar can speak Telepathically with each other.

• Spell Delivery: While within 10 Spaces of your Familiar,

you can cast a Spell with a range of Touch as if you were

standing in your Familiar’s Space.

Additional Traits: When you cast this Spell, you can spend

additional MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to grant

your Familiar 2 additional Traits per MP spent. You can

choose Traits from the Familiar Traits or Beast Traits (you

can’t choose Negative Traits).

Spell Actions

Pocket Dimension: You can spend a Minor Action to

dismiss the Familiar into a pocket dimension, summon it

from that pocket dimension, or summon it from anywhere

on the same plane of existence. When dismissed, any items

it was carrying are left behind. When summoned, it appears

in the nearest unoccupied Space of your choice.

Shared Senses: While your Familiar is within 20 Spaces,

you can spend 1 AP to connect your senses to the Familiar’s

senses until the end of your next turn. For the duration,

you’re Deafened and Blinded to your own senses but you

can see what your Familiar sees and hear what it hears. The

connection ends early if either of you moves farther than 20

Spaces from each other.

Managing the Familiar

Combat: The Familiar shares your Initiative, acting on

your turn. You can spend 1 AP to command the Familiar

to use an Action. It can’t take the Attack Action or Spell

Action unless it has a Familiar Feature that allows it to.

When you take an Action, your Familiar can move up to its

Speed immediately before or after the Action. If you don’t

command it, it takes the Dodge Action.

Shared MCP: When the Familiar makes a Check, it shares

your Multiple Check Penalty.

Death & Resurrection: Your Familiar dies when you die.

When it does, its body disappears and its spirit returns from

which it came. If you’re resurrected, the Familiar doesn’t

return to life until the next time you cast this Spell. When

it does, you follow the normal rules for recasting the Spell.
