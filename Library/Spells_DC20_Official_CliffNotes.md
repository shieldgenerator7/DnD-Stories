# Command

Enchantment

Cost: 2 AP + 1 MP

Range: 10 Spaces

Duration: 1 Round

You speak a command to a creature that you can see

within range that can hear you. You don’t have to see the

creature if you’ve seen them within the last minute. Make

a Spell Check contested by the target’s Charisma Save.

Success: The creature immediately spends 2 AP to follow

the command given, regardless of its usual AP cost. The

creature can’t spend any resources (AP, SP, or MP) to

modify the Action it takes.

Ignoring a Command: The Spell has no effect if the target

doesn’t understand your language, if it’s unable to follow

your command, or if your command is directly harmful to

itself.

Choosing a Command: You can choose from the list of

example commands below or improvise your own at the

GM’s discretion.

• Move: The target moves up to its Speed to a location (or

in a direction) of your choice.

• Prone: The target falls Prone.

• Drop: The target drops anything it’s holding.

• Attack: The target makes 1 Attack Check or Spell Check

(your choice) that normally costs 1 AP. You choose

the target of the Attack, which must be within the

commanded creature’s range.
