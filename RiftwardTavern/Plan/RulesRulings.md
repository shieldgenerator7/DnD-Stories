# Riftward Tavern Rules & Rulings

# Combat

## Opportunity of Attack

When a hostile creature uses its movement to move out of your melee range, you may use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the moving creature. This reaction may only be taken against a creature that you have attacked since the beginning of your last turn, or a creature that has attacked you since the beginning of your last turn. You can still take this reaction if you have not made any melee attacks nor been the target of any melee attacks since the beginning of your last turn.

When a creature fumbles an attack roll within your melee range, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the fumbling creature.

## Attacking

When you attack with a melee or ranged weapon, you may spend one of your hit dice to add its max value to your attack roll. You may do this before or after it has been determined whether or not the attack hits.

## Range

It’s harder to hit things at range. For every 60ft away the target is from you, the target gets +1 AC against your attacks.

## Crits

A crit on an attack roll is an automatic success, but you must still check to see if it beats the target’s AC. If the crit does not beat the target’s AC, roll damage like normal. If the crit beats the target’s AC, then the damage roll is automatically set to its max value.

Each crit gives you 1 crit point on the target. For each crit point you have on a target, you have +1 to hit against that target, and it lowers the number requirement to crit against that target by 1.  
Example: 3 crit points on an owlbear gives you +3 to hit against that owlbear, and now rolling a 17, 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll count as a crit against that owlbear.

When you roll a crit on an attack roll, process the hit and then roll on the d100 Crit table. Do what the Crit table says.

## Fumbles

The first thing you do when you roll a fumble on an attack roll is to roll on the d100 Fumble table. Players have advantage on this roll. If the Fumble table says to reroll, reroll the attack d20, and if it doesn’t roll a fumble, then the attack is no longer a fumble. If the Fumble table does not say to reroll, then do what it says and proceed with the following rules.

A fumble on an attack roll is not an automatic failure. It can still beat the target’s AC. If a fumble beats the target’s AC, roll damage like normal, but the damage is halved, rounded down.

When you fumble, creatures within melee range of you can use their reaction to make a melee weapon attack against you.

If you fumble a saving throw, you get 1 point of Exhaustion. If you fumble an ability check, nothing special happens.

## Dying

When a player drops to 0 hit points, they fall unconscious. Each turn, they privately roll a death saving throw to the DM. If they get a 5 or below, they fail a death saving throw. If they crit, they remove a failed death saving throw. If they fumble, they fail 3 death saving throws. When they fail 3 death saving throws, they die. This continues until they die or until they receive medical attention.

This rule applies to mobs and bosses as well.

When a creature receives medical attention, their hit points goes up to at least 1. Any amount of healing on a dying creature restores hit points and stabilizes them. When a dying creature is stabilized, they are no longer dying and they gain the Sleeping status.

When a dying creature takes damage, it instantly dies.

If a creature gets dropped to its hitpoint maximum in the negative, it dies instantly.

## Death

When a player dies, their body doesn’t start decaying until 1 hour after death. If revived within that 1 hour, the revived player will suffer no penalties for having died.

The player’s spells don’t disappear upon their death, unless that spell was a concentration spell.

# Jumping

## Long Jump

After running 10ft, you can jump a far distance. Make an Athletics check. The result of the roll is how many feet you travel midair, rounded up to the nearest 5ft.

If you run 20ft before jumping, you get advantage on the Athletics check and +5 to your roll.

If the total distance you traveled with this long jump plus the running start exceeds the movement distance you have for this turn, then your movement becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.

You may choose to half the rolled jump distance. If you do, upon landing, you may immediately make another long jump as if you had gotten a running start of 10ft.

Standing long jump: Make an Athletics check and half it, rounding down to the nearest 5ft. The result of the roll is how far you travel midair.

## High Jump

Your jump height is 3 plus your Strength modifier. You can make this jump from standing or from a running start.

# Falling

If a creature would start falling outside their turn, they only fall 10ft, and then fall the remaining distance at the end of their turn. Normal fall distance is capped at 100ft per turn.

# Saving Throws & Ability Checks

A player may willingly fail any saving throw or ability check they make, except for Constitution saving throws.

A player may exert themselves to add their relevant ability modifier to a saving throw or ability check, taking 2 points of exhaustion.

You gain a bonus to saving throws and ability checks equal to your sated points divided by 5, rounded up.

The minimum value for a DC is 0. If the DC is 0, the creature automatically succeeds without rolling any dice. A creature may not intentionally fail a saving throw or ability check with a DC of 0.

If you fumble a saving throw, you get 1 point of Exhaustion.

# Conditions

## Rooted

This is another name for Restrained.

## Sleeping / Asleep

A sleeping creature is unconscious. When they take damage, they regain consciousness.

## Transforming

A transforming creature is stunned and immune to all damage. Their stats don’t change to the new form’s stats until the Transforming condition ends.

## Stealthed X

You are hidden from view, or otherwise hard to notice. X is the DC required to notice you. A creature with passive perception X or greater and that can sense you notices you automatically. A creature looking for you must succeed on a DC X Wisdom (Perception) ability check in order to find you.

# Stealth

When you take the Hide action, you make a Stealth ability check. You then become Stealthed X, where X is the result of the ability check. You keep this status until you voluntarily end it, or until certain things happen. When you do the following things, reroll your Stealth ability check at disadvantage:

-   Attacking
-   Casting a spell with a target further than 5ft from you
-   Moving more than half your movement speed on your turn, rounded up to the nearest 5ft

You lose this status when the following things happen:

-   You voluntarily reveal yourself
-   Your cover or other method of hiding becomes unavailable to you

If a creature that notices you reveals you to another creature, that other creature gets +5 and advantage on their Perception ability check to notice you.

# Stacks

Creatures can gain stacks of an effect. These stacks can come from game mechanics (ex: crit points), items (ex: attunement points), or other things.

## Crit Points

Each crit point gives you +1 to hit and +1 crit range.

Example: 3 crit points gives you +3 to hit, and rolling a 17, 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll count as a crit.

## Exhaustion

Each point of exhaustion causes you to suffer the following drawbacks:

-   \-1 atk
-   \-1 to saving throws and ability checks
-   \-1 CON. If exhaustion causes your CON to go to 0, you die.
-   \-5ft move speed, with a minimum of 10ft.

The most common way to get Exhaustion is through exertion, where you push your body to its limits to ensure success. You also get exhaustion by fumbling saving throws, and it’s possible to get exhaustion by fumbling an attack roll, and other special circumstances.

## Sated

Sated points track how well-nourished you are.

You gain a bonus to saving throws and ability checks equal to your sated points divided by 5, rounded up.

Whenever you gain sated points, if your sated points are higher than your Constitution plus your Constitution modifier, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your sated points, or puke up your food and lose half of your sated points.

At the end of every hour, you lose 1 sated point.

If your sated points plus your Constitution modifier is equal to or greater than your Constitution, you are considered full.

## Attunement Points

Some items give you attunement points, which effect how the item behaves when you activate it. Attunement points are specific to each player and each item. A player has a different set of attunement points for each item they use, and each player has a different set of attunement points for an item that they all use.

## Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points can be stacked.

# Exertion

You can exert yourself in tight situations to give yourself a temporary edge, and then gain points of exhaustion.

If you know a spell but don’t have a spell slot to cast it, you can exert yourself to cast it. When the spell is done casting, you take X points of exhaustion, where X is the spell slot used to cast the spell.  
Example: A paladin wants to cast Divine Smite at 4th level, but doesn’t have any 4th level spell slots available, so he exerts himself to cast the spell. Then he takes 4 points of exhaustion.

When you make a weapon attack, you can exert yourself to double your attack roll. Then you gain X points of exhaustion, where X is the resulting attack value divided by 10, rounded up.  
Example: A rogue rolls a 12 for attack, but thinks it’s too low to hit, so the rogue exerts himself to double his attack roll to 24, which he thinks will hit. Then he takes 3 points of exhaustion.

You may exert yourself to add your relevant ability modifier to a saving throw or ability check, taking 2 points of exhaustion. You can only exert yourself once per saving throw or ability check.

When you exert yourself, you may ignore all effects of Exhaustion for the roll you exert yourself for.

You lose points of exhaustion when you finish a short or long rest.

# Magic Items

## Magic Words

Some magic items have words written on them that activate them. In order to activate them, you must be touching the magic item and say the magic words. You do not need to be touching the magic words on the item.

When an item mentions being activated by magic words, remember that you need to be touching the item for it to activate.

## Attunement Points

Some magic items give you attunement points, which effect how the item behaves for you over time. Attunement points are between that particular player and that particular item. A player can have attunement points for more than one item, but those attunement points are separate. More than one player can have attunement points for the same item, but those attunement points are separate.

## Removing Worn Items

Some items can be worn. Normally, only the creature wearing the item is able to take it off or put it on. But, if the creature wearing the item is willing, any creature may remove the item from the wearer.

# Ties

When an attack roll ties with an AC, the attack hits.

When a grapple check ties with the dodging Acrobatics check, the grapple check wins.

When a saving throw ties with a saving throw DC, the saving throw is a success.

In general, when an ability check ties with the DC, the ability check succeeds.

# Hit Dice

Hit dice can be spent to increase an attack roll. When you make an attack roll, you can spent a hit die to add its maximum value to the attack roll.

When you get hit by an attack, you can spend a hit die to add its maximum value to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.

When you finish a short rest you can spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value.

When you finish a long rest you can spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value plus your Constitution modifier.

You can regain hit dice from a long rest.

# Resting

## Short Rest

A short rest is at least 1 hour long total, with no more than 10 minutes of interruption total.

When you finish a short rest, you gain the following benefits, in order:

1.  You may spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value.
2.  You lose 1 point of exhaustion.
3.  You may spend sated points up to your Constitution modifier to heal for the amount of sated points spent.

7.  You recover all spell slots.

# Eating & Drinking

As an action, you can eat food or drink water to gain 1 sated point.

Sated points give you bonuses to saving throws and ability checks, can be spent to heal during rests, and help regain hit dice and recover from exhaustion after a long rest.

You are considered full if your sated points plus your Constitution modifier is equal to or greater than your Constitution.
