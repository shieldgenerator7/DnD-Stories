# Riftward Tavern Rules & Rulings

# Combat

## Opportunity of Attack

When a creature uses its movement to move out of melee range of another hostile creature, the hostile creature may use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the moving creature. This reaction may only be taken against a creature that has made an attack against the reacting creature within the last 2 rounds, or against a creature that the reacting creature has made an attack against within the last 2 rounds, or if the reacting creature has not made any melee attacks nor been the target of any melee attacks for the last 2 rounds. The reacting creature must also be conscious and not prone.

## Initiative

Any player can declare they’re rolling for initiative at any time, in addition to the dm.

Initiative is automatically rolled when a creature deals damage to another without killing it.

Initiative doesn’t stop once all monsters are dead. Initiative only stops when all players agree to stop initiative.

## Crits

A crit on an attack roll is an automatic success, but you must still check to see if it beats the target’s AC. If the crit does not beat the target’s AC, roll damage like normal. If the crit beats the target’s AC, then the damage roll is automatically set to its max value.

A crit grants you +1 atk against the target, and it lowers the number requirement for a crit by 1.

## Fumbles

A fumble on an attack roll is not an automatic failure. It can still beat the target’s AC. If a fumble beats the target’s AC, roll damage like normal, but the target takes half damage.

## Death

When a player dies, their body doesn’t start decaying until 1 hour after death. If revived within that 1 hour, the revived player will suffer no penalties for having died.

The player’s spells don’t disappear upon their death, unless that spell was a concentration spell.

# Jumping

## Long Jump

After running 10ft, you can jump a far distance. Make an Athletics check. The result of the roll is how many feet you travel midair, rounded up to the nearest 5ft.

If you run 20ft before jumping, you get advantage on the Athletics check and +5 to your roll.

If the total distance you traveled with this long jump plus the running start exceeds the movement distance you have for this turn, then your movement becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.

You may choose to half the rolled jump distance. If you do, upon landing, you may immediately make another long jump as if you had gotten a running start of 10ft.

Standing long jump: Make an Athletics check and half it, rounding down to the nearest 5ft. The result of the roll is how far you travel midair.

## High Jump

Your jump height is 3 plus your Strength modifier. You can make this jump from standing or from a running start.

# Saving Throws & Ability Checks

A player may willingly fail any saving throw or ability check they make, except for Constitution saving throws.

# Conditions

## Rooted

This is another name for Restrained.

## Stealthed X

You are hidden from view, or otherwise hard to notice. X is the DC required to notice you. A creature with passive perception X or greater and that can sense you notices you automatically. A creature looking for you must succeed on a DC X Wisdom (Perception) ability check in order to find you.

# Stealth

When you take the Hide action, you make a Stealth ability check. You then become Stealthed X, where X is the result of the ability check. You keep this status until you voluntarily end it, or until certain things happen. When you do the following things, reroll your Stealth ability check at disadvantage:

-   Attacking
-   Casting a spell with a target further than 5ft from you
-   Moving more than half your movement speed on your turn, rounded up to the nearest 5ft

You lose this status when the following things happen:

-   You voluntarily reveal yourself
-   Your cover or other method of hiding becomes unavailable to you

If a creature that notices you reveals you to another creature, that other creature gets advantage on their Perception ability check to notice you.
