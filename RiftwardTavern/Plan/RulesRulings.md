# Riftward Tavern Rules & Rulings

# Combat

## Opportunity of Attack

When a creature uses its movement to move out of melee range of another hostile creature, the hostile creature may use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the moving creature. This reaction may only be taken against a creature that has made an attack against the reacting creature within the last 2 rounds, or against a creature that the reacting creature has made an attack against within the last 2 rounds, or if the reacting creature has not made any melee attacks nor been the target of any melee attacks for the last 2 rounds. The reacting creature must also be conscious and not prone.

When a creature fumbles an attack roll within your melee range, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the fumbling creature. You must be conscious and not prone.

## Initiative

Any player can declare they’re rolling for initiative at any time, in addition to the dm.

Initiative is automatically rolled when a creature deals damage to another without killing it.

Initiative doesn’t stop once all monsters are dead. Initiative only stops when all players agree to stop initiative.

## Attacking

When you attack with a melee or ranged weapon, you may spend one of your hit dice to add its max value to your attack roll. You may do this before or after it has been determined whether or not the attack hits.

## Crits

A crit on an attack roll is an automatic success, but you must still check to see if it beats the target’s AC. If the crit does not beat the target’s AC, roll damage like normal. If the crit beats the target’s AC, then the damage roll is automatically set to its max value.

Each crit gives you 1 crit point on the target. For each crit point you have on a target, you have +1 to hit against that target, and it lowers the number requirement to crit against that target by 1.  
Example: 3 crit points on an owlbear gives you +3 to hit against that owlbear, and now rolling a 17, 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll count as a crit against that owlbear.

If the attack roll is not a crit, but is double the target’s AC or more, it becomes a crit.

## Fumbles

A fumble on an attack roll is not an automatic failure. It can still beat the target’s AC. If a fumble beats the target’s AC, roll damage like normal, but the damage is halved, rounded down.

When you fumble, creatures within melee range of you can use their reaction to make a melee weapon attack against you.

If the fumble is double the target’s AC or more, it does not become a crit.

## Dying

When a player drops to 0 hit points, they fall unconscious. If they don’t receive medical attention by the end of their third turn dead, they die.

This rule applies to mobs and bosses as well.

When a creature receives medical attention, their hit points goes up to at least 1. Any amount of healing on a dying creature restores hit points and stabilizes them. When a dying creature is stabilized, they gain the Sleeping status.

## Death

When a player dies, their body doesn’t start decaying until 1 hour after death. If revived within that 1 hour, the revived player will suffer no penalties for having died.

The player’s spells don’t disappear upon their death, unless that spell was a concentration spell.

# Jumping

## Long Jump

After running 10ft, you can jump a far distance. Make an Athletics check. The result of the roll is how many feet you travel midair, rounded up to the nearest 5ft.

If you run 20ft before jumping, you get advantage on the Athletics check and +5 to your roll.

If the total distance you traveled with this long jump plus the running start exceeds the movement distance you have for this turn, then your movement becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.

You may choose to half the rolled jump distance. If you do, upon landing, you may immediately make another long jump as if you had gotten a running start of 10ft.

Standing long jump: Make an Athletics check and half it, rounding down to the nearest 5ft. The result of the roll is how far you travel midair.

## High Jump

Your jump height is 3 plus your Strength modifier. You can make this jump from standing or from a running start.

# Falling

If a creature would start falling outside their turn, they only fall 10ft, and then fall the remaining distance at the end of their turn. Normal fall distance is capped at 40ft per turn.

# Saving Throws & Ability Checks

A player may willingly fail any saving throw or ability check they make, except for Constitution saving throws.

A player may exert themselves to add their level to a saving throw or ability check, taking 1 point of exhaustion.

You gain a bonus to saving throws and ability checks equal to your sated points divided by 5, rounded up.

# Conditions

## Rooted

This is another name for Restrained.

## Stealthed X

You are hidden from view, or otherwise hard to notice. X is the DC required to notice you. A creature with passive perception X or greater and that can sense you notices you automatically. A creature looking for you must succeed on a DC X Wisdom (Perception) ability check in order to find you.

# Stealth

When you take the Hide action, you make a Stealth ability check. You then become Stealthed X, where X is the result of the ability check. You keep this status until you voluntarily end it, or until certain things happen. When you do the following things, reroll your Stealth ability check at disadvantage:

-   Attacking
-   Casting a spell with a target further than 5ft from you
-   Moving more than half your movement speed on your turn, rounded up to the nearest 5ft

You lose this status when the following things happen:

-   You voluntarily reveal yourself
-   Your cover or other method of hiding becomes unavailable to you

If a creature that notices you reveals you to another creature, that other creature gets advantage on their Perception ability check to notice you.

# Stacks

Creatures can gain stacks of an effect. These stacks can come from game mechanics (ex: crit points), items (ex: attunement points), or other things.

By default, you lose all stacks of everything on death.

## Crit Points

Each crit point gives you +1 to hit and +1 crit range.

Example: 3 crit points gives you +3 to hit, and rolling a 17, 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll count as a crit.

## Exhaustion

Each point of exhaustion causes you to suffer -1 to hit and -1 CON. If exhaustion causes your CON to go to 0, you die. It also reduces your movement speed by -1ft. Your movement speed is rounded down to the nearest 5ft, with a minimum of 10ft.

## Sated

Sated points track how well-nourished you are.

You gain a bonus to saving throws and ability checks equal to your sated points divided by 5, rounded up.

Whenever you gain sated points, if your sated points are higher than your Constitution plus your Constitution modifier, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your sated points, or puke up your food and lose half of your sated points.

At the end of every hour, you lose 1 sated point.

If your sated points plus your Constitution modifier is equal to or greater than your Constitution, you are considered full.

## Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points can be stacked.

# Exertion

You can exert yourself in tight situations to give yourself a temporary edge, and then gain points of exhaustion.

If you know a spell but don’t have a spell slot to cast it, you can exert yourself to cast it. When the spell is done casting, you take X points of exhaustion, where X is the spell slot used to cast the spell.  
Example: A paladin wants to cast Divine Smite at 4th level, but doesn’t have any 4th level spell slots available, so he exerts himself to cast the spell. Then he takes 4 points of exhaustion.

When you make a weapon attack, you can exert yourself to double your attack roll. Then you gain X points of exhaustion, where X is the resulting attack value divided by 10, rounded up.  
Example: A rogue rolls a 12 for attack, but it won’t hit, so the rogue exerts himself to double his attack roll to 24, which hits. Then he takes 3 points of exhaustion.

You may exert yourself to add your level to a saving throw or ability check, taking 1 point of exhaustion. You can only exert yourself once per saving throw or ability check.

You lose points of exhaustion when you finish a short or long rest.

# Magic Items

A lot of magic items have words written on them that activate them. In order activate them, you must be touching the magic item and say the magic words. You do not need to be touching the magic words on the item.

When an item mentions being activated by magic words, remember that you need to be touching the item for it to activate.

# Ties

When an attack roll ties with an AC, the attack hits.

When a grapple check ties with the dodging Acrobatics check, the grapple check wins.

When a saving throw ties with a saving throw, the saving throw is a success.

In general, when an ability check ties with the DC, the ability check succeeds.

# Hit Dice

Hit dice can be spent to increase an attack roll. When you make an attack roll, you can spent a hit die to add its maximum value to the attack roll.

When you get hit by an attack, you can spend a hit die to add its maximum value to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.

When you finish a short rest you can spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value.

When you finish a long rest you can spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value plus your Constitution modifier.

You can regain hit dice from a long rest or by eating.

# Resting

## Short Rest

A short rest is at least 1 hour long total, with no more than 10 minutes of interruption total.

When you finish a short rest you can spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value. You lose 1 point of exhaustion. You can spend sated points up to your Constitution modifier to heal for the amount of sated points spent.

## Long Rest

A long rest is at least 8 hours long total, with no more than 1 hour of interruption total.

When you finish a long rest you can spend any number of hit dice. You heal for their total maximum value plus your Constitution modifier. Then you regain 1 hit die. You lose 4 points of exhaustion. Then, if you have no points of exhaustion, you regain 1 hit die. You may then spend any number of sated points to heal for the same amount. If your sated points were equal to or greater than you Constitution when you started the long rest, you regain 1 additional hit die and lose an additional 4 points of exhaustion.

# Eating & Drinking

As an action, you can eat food or drink water to gain 1 sated point.
