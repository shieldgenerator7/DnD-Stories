# Opportunity of Attack

When a creature uses its movement to move out of melee range of another hostile creature, the hostile creature may use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the moving creature. This reaction may only be taken against a creature that has made an attack against the reacting creature within the last 2 rounds, or against a creature that the reacting creature has made an attack against within the last 2 rounds, or if the reacting creature has not made any melee attacks nor been the target of any melee attacks for the last 2 rounds. The reacting creature must also be conscious.
