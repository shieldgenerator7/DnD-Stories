# Riftward Tavern DM Style Notes

Here are some notes about how I plan to DM this campaign.

# Rules Questions

I will assume you are familiar with the DnD rules and the custom rules page. I will accept any questions regarding the rules, and am open to editing the rules to make them more clear.

I will not argue rules in the middle of a session, if you want to debate the rules and how to interpret them, we can do that after the session or between sessions.

If you make a decision based on a faulty understanding of the rules, I will allow you to take it back and make another decision, provided that it doesn’t break Schroedinger’s Law. However, if the decision is relatively recent, and events following it are easy to undo, then an exception may be made, at the dm’s discretion.

# Schroedinger’s Law

If an event is not yet important to the story, it hasn’t really happened yet.

Things that happened in the past can be changed or retconned so long as changing them doesn’t break the story so far in the campaign.

Example: You eat a ham sandwich and then a fight starts in front of you, which you join. Afterwards you remember your character doesn’t like ham, so you change the sandwich to a turkey sandwich. Schroedinger’s Law says that because the type of sandwich isn’t yet important to the story, it can be changed with no problem. So now your character ate a turkey sandwich instead.

Example: Your character can either go down into a dark basement or upstairs to a social event. Your character goes into the dark basement and gets trapped, combat ensues, and the party rescues you. You then remember your character doesn’t have darkvision and wouldn’t have been able to navigate the dark basement into the trap, thus your character would have actually upstairs to the social event. Schroedinger’s Law says that because which way your character went is now important to the story, that part can’t be changed. Your character went into the basement. But now events must be retconned so things make sense: your character went into the basement with a lit torch.

This is the basic rule that I will be using to determine whether or not something can be retconned.

# Novelization

As you know, when I, shieldgenerator7, play D&D, I take notes and write up a novelization of what happened in the session. As a DM, I’m not sure if I can do that and manage the game at the same time. I would greatly appreciate it if a player would step up and take notes for me during the sessions.

# Combat

This game is going to be very combat-heavy, so I want it to go as smoothly as possible. To this end, I’m going to set a time limit of player turns. If a player takes too long to say what they’re going to do, I’m going to say their character automatically takes the dodge action. I’ll try to also say who’s up next so that it’s easier for players to get their actions ready.

## Initiative

Any player can declare they’re rolling for initiative at any time, in addition to the dm.

Initiative is automatically rolled when a creature deals damage to another without killing it.

Initiative doesn’t stop once all monsters are dead. Initiative only stops when all players agree to stop initiative.

## Damage

Sometimes damage rolls get modified based on the target’s conditions, like when a barbarian takes half damage from rage. When I tell someone how much damage they take, the number will be already halved. So I will do the halving, and not the player. All the player needs to do is decrease their health bar by the amount that I tell them.

It is ok to remind of effects that effect damage calculations if you think I might have forgotten.

# Inspiration

Inspiration points will last until the end of the session that they’re granted. Keeping them temporary gives the players more incentive to use them, imo.

I want to reward players for thinking tactically and coming up with clever ways to take down their enemies. I also want to reward players for playing in character.

# Crits and Fumbles

I plan on implementing custom rules for crits and fumbles, detailed in the custom rules document. The changes are overall designed to make combat damage more consistent and less bursty and less brutal.

I plan on using crit and fumble tables for both players and NPCs. But don’t worry, I’m using a custom table for both. The fumble table has a 20% chance of letting you reroll, a 10% chance of doing nothing, and a 70% chance of mildly inconveniencing you. There are no grave dangers like breaking your weapon or damaging yourself by accident.

NPCs roll the crit table at disadvantage, and players roll the fumble table at advantage. This way, NPCs get rewarded less for crits, and players get punished less for fumbles.

If you fumble, but the attack still hits, then you don’t roll on the fumble table.
