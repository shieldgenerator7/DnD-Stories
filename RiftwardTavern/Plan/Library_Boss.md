# Astalir

A magical deer from the Minotaur’s Maze campaign. This particular deer might be another deer of the same species, and not necessarily the same Astalir.

In a forest with lots to eat, there’s a large herd of deer. But they’re suspiciously all bucks with the same big glorious antlers.

Plateau: 90 10ft squares 30ft up. Chasm: 10 10ft squares 210ft down (meaning 240ft drop from plateau)

Saving throw: Dexterity DC15; Advantage: quadrupedal creatures, creatures already prone, creatures holding onto something stable

### River
