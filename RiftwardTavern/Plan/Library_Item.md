# Riftward Tavern Item Library

Items that will be helpful on the journey.

Some items are given to you at the start of the adventure. These are marked as starting items.

Some items are legendary and have a legendary item attunement requirement. The first player to meet this requirement gains a level. Other players may also attune to the item by meeting the requirement afterwards, but they don’t gain a level from it.

## Riftward Tavern Handkerchief

Starting Item, Uncommon

Protects against magic radiation for 24 hours. Return to a Riftward Tavern location to refresh the duration.

It has a magic word written on it. As an action, you may touch the handkerchief and speak the magic word. Then 1 minute later, the handkerchief teleports every creature touching or wearing it, dead or alive, to the last Riftward Tavern that refreshed it.

Upon leaving a Riftward Tavern location, it becomes boosted for 1 hour, granting you Passage Protection. While moving towards other Riftward Tavern Handkerchiefs, you gain 5x your normal walk speed and +10 to all saving throws. It stops being boosted if time runs out, if you move within 100ft of a non-boosted Riftward Tavern Handkerchief, or if you deal damage.

Requires attunement. When attuned, it may take the form of a scarf, wristband, collar, belt, or other article of clothing of your choice that has a similar surface area.

*This item is designed to protect travelers from magic radiation and facilitate regrouping, whether back at the tavern or another location.*

## Riftward Tavern Map

Starting Item, Rare

A paper map that magically updates whenever you enter a Riftward Tavern location. The map shows the area in the vicinity of the tavern. It also shows you where you are on the map.

## Riftward Tavern Door Knob

Starting Item, Legendary

When placed in a door, it attaches to it and casts Dimension Door on it. The door’s frame then contains a portal to any door also effected by this knob. By knocking on the door and saying the name of the location you want to go to, you can change which Riftward Tavern location the portal opens to. This works even after the doorknob has been removed from the door.

*This is the artifact you use to reconnect the taverns.*

## Ring of Accessibility

Uncommon (3), Rare (5), Very Rare (7), Legendary (9)

Requires attunement. When you attune to this ring, choose a spell level up to this ring’s max spell level (based on its rarity). You gain 1 spell slot in that level. Choose a spell from your class’s spell list of that level or below. You may memorize and cast that spell even if you don’t meet the requirements.

Once you expend the spell slot of this ring, you don’t get it back until you complete a long rest.

## Lantern of Revealing

## Hamgorg’s Tremor Hammer

Whenever you hit an attack with this hammer, make a DC 15 Strength check. If you pass, the hammer creates a tremor in a 15ft radius of the target struck. All creatures in range must make a DC (1d4 + 10) Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. You have advantage on this saving throw, and the target struck has disadvantage. Creatures that get knocked prone and that are within 5ft of a ledge must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they fall off the ledge.

## Mud Scoop

1d4 Bludgeoning

A metal shovel designed for scooping mud. The mud that is scraped off this shovel can be thrown. On impact, the mud will take its new shape and harden into rock instantly.

As an object interaction on your turn, or as a reaction, you may put the True Sight Scope up to your eye until the beginning of your next turn. Illusions in a cone in front of you become transparent, and secret doors and traps are revealed. The cone length and radius are both equal to your Intelligence modifier times 10.

## Stockholm Cuffs

Place these cuffs on a creature that is not under any mental effects, and place the other end on a creature that is under a mental effect. At the end of every hour, the sane creature makes a DC35 Charisma ability check. On a failure, the DC lowers by 1 until the cuffs are removed from the effected creature. On a success, the effected creature becomes free from all mental effects on it, including Cold Stare.  
While wearing these cuffs, both creatures must remain with 5ft of each other. If they try to separate, they make contested Strength checks. The one who loses gets moved to the closest position within 5ft of the other. If they tie, the creature trying to move gets their movement cancelled, expending that 5ft of movement. Either creature may intentionally fail this check.  
The two creatures in these cuffs have advantage on melee attacks against each other, and disadvantage on saving throws from spells cast by the other creature.
