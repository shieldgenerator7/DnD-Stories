# Riftward Tavern Item Library

Items that will be helpful on the journey.

Some items are given to you at the start of the adventure. These are marked as starting items.

Some items are legendary and have a legendary item attunement requirement. The first player to meet this requirement gains a level. Other players may also attune to the item by meeting the requirement afterwards, but they don’t gain a level from it.

# Riftward Tavern Handkerchief

Starting Item, Uncommon

It has magic words written on it. As an action, you may say the magic words. Then 1 minute later, the handkerchief teleports every creature touching or wearing it, dead or alive, to the last Riftward Tavern that it visited.

Upon leaving a Riftward Tavern location, it becomes boosted for 1 hour, granting you Passage Protection. While moving towards other Riftward Tavern Handkerchiefs, you gain 5x your normal walk speed and +10 to all saving throws. It stops being boosted if time runs out, if you move within 100ft of a non-boosted Riftward Tavern Handkerchief, or if you deal damage.

While worn, it may take the form of a scarf, wristband, collar, belt, or other article of clothing of your choice that has a similar surface area.
