Items that will be helpful on the journey.

Some items are legendary and have a legendary item attunement requirement. The first player to meet this requirement gains a level. Other players may also attune to the item by meeting the requirement afterwards, but they don’t gain a level from it.

Whenever you hit an attack with this hammer, make a DC 15 Strength check. If you pass, the hammer creates a tremor in a 15ft radius of the target struck. All creatures in range must make a DC (1d4 + 10) Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. You have advantage on this saving throw, and the target struck has disadvantage. Creatures that get knocked prone and that are within 5ft of a ledge must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they fall off the ledge.

## Mud Scoop

1d4 Bludgeoning

A metal shovel designed for scooping mud. The mud that is scraped off this shovel can be thrown. On impact, the mud will take its new shape and harden into rock instantly.

## Stockholm Cuffs

Place these cuffs on a creature that is not under any mental effects, and place the other end on a creature that is under a mental effect.

On a success, the effected creature becomes free from all mental effects on it, including Cold Stare.  
While wearing these cuffs, both creatures must remain with 5ft of each other. If they try to separate, they make contested Strength checks. The one who loses gets moved to the closest position within 5ft of the other. If they tie, the creature trying to move gets their movement cancelled, expending that 5ft of movement. Either creature may intentionally fail this check.  
The two creatures in these cuffs have advantage on melee attacks against each other, and disadvantage on saving throws from spells cast by the other creature.

**Hoof Attack**  
Reach 5ft +6 atk 2d6+4 bludgeoning damage

On a success, the creature’s features become less horse-like and the DC decreases by 5. After 3 successes, the creature is stunned for 1 round as they transform completely back into what they were before, ending the effect. Putting the harness back on resets both the DC and the successes, transforming the creature completely back into a horse.
