Riftward Tavern Invitation

You are hereby invited to the Riftward Tavern!

For many years now, the esteemed Riftward Tavern has provided food and lodging to guests travelling through the rift to other locations. But the tavern lacks other amenities, being located on the side of a mountain far from other towns. That’s where you come in!

As a renowned and reputable shopkeeper, you are hereby invited to move your shop to a plot of land next to the Riftward Tavern on the side of Mount Breckidge. We have several good quality plots carved out of the mountain just ready to be filled. Each plot includes a steady water supply, reliable sewage management, and an incredible mountainside view. Plus, you get a free nightly beer, on us!

Rent of the plot will be free as long as you remain in good standing with the tavern. A contract will be signed when an agreement has been made. We can accommodate you if you need helping moving your shop and/or home. We will also help with informing customers that your shop will be moving.

If you accept this offer, simply circle “Yes” below.

Will you accept this offer to move your business to the Riftward Tavern?
