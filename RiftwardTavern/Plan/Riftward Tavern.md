Riftward Tavern (D&D Campaign)

Thinking about a D&D campaign I’d run if I did one for Dice May Fall. It’s heavily inspired by Metroidvanias.

# Premise

You start as a townie in the Riftward Tavern, the local tavern. A giant wave of energy washes over the area, twisting and changing things. Everyone inside the tavern is safe, but the dimension door to the other locations of the tavern has been disrupted. It falls on you, the lowly townspeople to venture out into the magically radiated unknown to reconnect the tavern’s dimensional doors.

You start as a non-adventurer “NPC” at level 1, inside the Riftward Tavern on the night of the incident. The tavern keeper gives you adventuring items and tells you how to find the other Riftward Tavern locations, and what to do when you find them.

Outside the protection of the tavern, the land is contaminated with magic radiation. It twists and changes things in its wake, often in random waves.

# Items

## Riftward Tavern Handkerchief

Uncommon

Protects against magic radiation for 24 hours. Return to a Riftward Tavern location to reset the duration.

If you take lethal damage, it casts Teleport on you and takes you to the last Riftward Tavern location you visited.

Upon leaving a Riftward Tavern location, it becomes boosted for 1 hour, granting you Passage Protection. While moving towards a non-boosted Riftward Tavern Handkerchief, you gain 5x your normal walk speed and +10 to all saving throws. It stops being boosted if time runs out, if you move within 100 ft of a non-boosted Riftward Tavern Handkerchief, or if you deal damage.

Requires attunement. When attuned, it may take the form of a scarf, wristband, collar, belt, or other article of clothing of your choice that has a similar surface area.

*This item is designed to protect travelers from magic radiation and death, and facilitate regrouping after getting picked off.*

## Riftward Tavern Map

Rare

A paper map that magically updates whenever you enter a Riftward Tavern location. The map shows the area in the vicinity of the tavern. It also shows you where you are on the map.

## Riftward Tavern Door Knob

Legendary

When placed in a door, it casts Dimension Door on it. The door’s frame then contains a portal to any door also effected by this knob. By knocking on the door and saying the name of the location you want to go to, you can change which Riftward Tavern location the portal opens to. This works even after the doorknob has been removed from the door.

*This is the artifact you use to reconnect the taverns.*

## Ring of Accessibility

Uncommon (3), Rare (5), Very Rare (7), Legendary (9)

Requires attunement. When you attune to this ring, choose a spell level up to this ring’s max spell level (based on its rarity). You gain 1 spell slot in that level. Choose a spell from your class’s spell list of that level or below. You may memorize and cast that spell even if you don’t meet the level requirement.

Once you expend the spell slot of this ring, you don’t get it back until you complete a long rest.

## Hamgorg’s Hammer

Hammer – Legendary  
Damage: 1d12 Bludgeoning

\+10 to attack against targets that can’t move

Whenever you attack a target that can’t move with this hammer, make a Strength check with a DC equal to the target’s armor rating. If you succeed, you knock a hole in the target if it is a wall, destroy it if it is a pillar, or cripple it if it is a creature.
