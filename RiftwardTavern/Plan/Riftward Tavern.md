Riftward Tavern (D&D Campaign)

Thinking about a D&D campaign I’d run if I did one for Dice May Fall. It’s heavily inspired by Metroidvanias.

# Premise

You start as a townie in the Riftward Tavern, the local tavern. A giant wave of energy washes over the area, twisting and changing things. Everyone inside the tavern is safe, but the dimension door to the other locations of the tavern has been disrupted. It falls on you, the lowly townspeople to venture out into the magically radiated unknown to reconnect the tavern’s dimensional doors.

You start as a non-adventurer “NPC” at level 1, inside the Riftward Tavern on the night of the incident. The tavern keeper gives you adventuring items and tells you how to find the other Riftward Tavern locations, and what to do when you find them.

Outside the protection of the tavern, the land is contaminated with magic radiation. It twists and changes things in its wake, often in random waves.
