# Leaf Riders of Wrenwood Side Quest Calendar – January 2024

This side quest calendar is fan content designed to work with the 2024 Quest Calendar by Sundial Games. The official calendar is required to play this side quest. You can get it here:  
https://sundialgamesllc.itch.io/2024-quest-calendar

This side quest calendar follows fan-created characters, but includes canon characters. It supplements the quest you play in the main calendar. Starting out, you’ll be playing Rut Quakehoof, a deer earth bender.

## How to Use

At the start of the day, do this side quest calendar as Rut first, as it may override what you do on the main calendar page. Then do the main quest calendar as the main character (Tak for the first week). The main calendar page follows the main character, and the side quest calendar page follows a supporting character (Rut for the first week). The two characters can interact with each other and effect each other’s rolls and results.

It’s a good idea to record your rolls for ability checks. Sometimes they’re mentioned in a future page. If you don’t remember what you rolled, assume you rolled a 2.

When you find a pickpocket or backpack symbol on a page, you may roll it for both Tak and Rut separately. You may roll the Sunday Lottery for both Tak and Rut separately.

Start the side quest calendar with the following character, Rut Quakehoof.

# 0 - Rut Quakehoof – Earth Molder (Deer)

Naturally talented at earth bending, he passed his classes at the Academy of Elemental Arts with flying colors. He crushed his competition, making them eat his dust. He got away with doing less than his best work, so he barely tries. He likes to hang out and relax, and thought that guard duty was a perfect opportunity to do just that.

Tak Redwind and him are buddies, but he annoys Tak with his persistent unwillingness to put in any effort. And Tak annoys him with his undying encouragement and work ethic.

He was assigned to The Burrows, traveling there with Tak from Crownspire City after graduation. He hopes that the current peace will continue as long as he is on watch.

# Monday, January 1, 2024

You arrive at The Burrow early for your first day of duty. There is some time to explore and get familiar with the outpost before you must report to Sergeant Furfoot.

1.  Convince Tak to explore with you. [roll d20 + Charisma]
2.  Explore all the areas of the outpost in any order you desire.

=======

While The Burrow is primarily a military outpost and training ground, several civilian facilities and accommodations exist to create a small-town atmosphere.

There are many enticing smells and sounds that catch your interest.

## 1. Convince Tak to explore with you. [roll d20 + Charisma]

“Hey, Tak, we’ve been traveling for a long time. Let’s take a break and have some fun.”

If you are also playing Tak, you may choose to automatically roll either a 2 or 19.

**If the result is 14 or less:** Tak shakes his head and wanders off on his own. “There’s work to be done here, we’ve got to help out the best we can.”

**If the result is 15 or more:** Tak shrugs and follows along. “I am pretty tired after that journey. I could use a little break. But right after we report to the sergeant, ok?” Tak is with you for the rest of the page.

## 2. Explore all the areas of the outpost in any order you desire.

Options include: Waterfall, Acornball Court, Cooking Site, Bunker

If Tak is with you, he doesn’t explore the Fallen Tree or Supply Post areas from his page.

### Waterfall

If Tak is with you, you may choose to do his Waterfall challenge on the main calendar page first, rolling separately for Tak and Rut.

If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, he happens to meet you here, and is with you for this area.

At the Waterfall, you find several people relaxing in the hot springs behind the falls. The walls of the spring are made of hardened dirt. They welcome you to come sit with them. If you do, [roll d20 + Constitution]. Reminder: Earth Molder

**If the result is 8 or less:** As you sit down, you sit on a sharp rock. They laugh at you. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is between 9 and 16:** You sit down and make a comfy spot for yourself. You have a nice chat with the locals.

**If the result is 17 or more:** As you sit down, you mold the dirt beneath you to achieve the perfect levels of comfort. The others around you notice and ask how you did that. You mold the dirt around them too, increasing their comfort level. Gain 1 Virtue. If Tak is with you, you and Tak both restore 1 health.

### Acornball Court

Some civilians have set up an area in a patch of dirt to play Acornball. They need another player to join their team, and invite you. If you join their Acornball team, [roll d20 + Dexterity]. Reminder: Earth Molder

If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, you convince him to join your team, and he is with you for this area.

If Tak is with you, you gain a +2 bonus to this roll.

**If the result is 8 or less:** You get hit in the face with an acorn and your team loses. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is between 9 and 16:** You play and have lots of fun. Your team loses, but you’re a good sport about it and everyone had fun.

**If the result is 17 or more:** You score the final point and your team wins! You find 1 amber buried in the dirt. If Tak is with you, you may give the 1 amber to him instead. Note down “Team Synergy” somewhere for future reference.

If Tak is with you, you may play this challenge again as Tak.

### Cooking Site

After all that activity, you sure are hungry. You find a bustling area at the cooking site filled with delicious aromas. People are busy preparing meals or volunteering to lend a hand. If you would like to help with distributing meals, [roll d20 + Strength]. Reminder: Earth Molder

**If the result is 8 or less:** You spill the food, creating a mess. Hot boiling water spills on your legs. Reduce your health by 2.

**If the result is between 9 and 12:** You distribute the food, but you get in the way of other people. The head cook tells you to sit down.

**If the result is 13 or more:** You distribute the food easily and efficiently. The head cook gives you 1 amber for saving him so much time.

Afterwards, you sit down to enjoy your meal.

If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, he happens to meet you here, and is with you for this area.

If Tak is with you, and you are playing Tak, remember what you rolled for the d20 + Wisdom roll for the Cooking Site on the main page. If Tak succeeded on this roll (11 or more), then restore 1 health. If Tak failed this roll (10 or less), then your food does not smell appetizing. If you eat it anyway, [roll d20 + Constitution].

**If the result is 10 or less:** The food makes you sick, and you puke it up. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is between 11 and 14:** The food tastes bad, but you eat it anyway. You tell Tak that it’s not so bad. “Thanks, I might pick this up as a hobby,” Tak says. Your ears pin back as you try to smile.

**If the result is 15 or more:** You swallow it whole and barely notice the taste. You give Tak a big thumbs up. Restore 1 health.

### Bunker

You look for the place where you’ll be sleeping, but all the burrows look the same. The burrows are all homes dug out from the dirt. In an attempt to find the bunker assigned to you, [roll d20 + Wisdom]. Reminder: Earth Molder

If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, you run into him on your way, and is with you for this area.

If Tak is with you, roll for Tak and Rut separately, and then take the higher of the two rolls.

**If the result is 10 or less:** You find your bunker, and start to settle in. But then someone comes in and tells you that you’re in their house. You got the wrong burrow! You leave, tired and demoralized. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is 11 or more:** You find your bunker and settle in. While you’re here, you take a nap. Gain a +2 bonus to the next roll you make on this page. If Tak is with you, he also gains a +2 bonus to the next roll he makes on the main page.

# Tuesday, January 2, 2024

After Sergeant Furfoot addresses and dismisses Tak, he turns to you.

You stand at attention before Sergeant Furfoot as he gives you a list of your duties for the day. “Listen up, Rut. As a new member of The Burrows, you have much to prove. I have some important jobs for you to handle today.”

Do all the tasks:

1.  Patrol the perimeter. [roll d20 + Wisdom]
2.  Clean the training grounds. [roll d20 + Constitution] Reminder: Earth Molder
3.  Haul some supplies. [roll d20 + Strength]

=======

Do task \#1 (Patrol the perimeter) as Tak on the main page first, then come back here.

## 1. Patrol the perimeter. [roll d20 + Wisdom]

“I need you to patrol the outer perimeter of The Burrows. Keep an eye out for any signs of intruders or suspicious activity. Report back immediately if you spot anything out of the ordinary.”

On patrol, you find the compost pile before too long. It stinks like rotten eggs in an outhouse.

**If the result is 7 or less:** You quickly walk the perimeter, trying to observe the grounds beyond. With it being your first day, you aren’t sure what constitutes unusual activity, except for maybe the unusual smell of the compost pile. You report this to Sg Furfoot, but he is not amused. “Stop getting distracted, Rut,” he reprimands you.

**If the result is between 8 and 14:** Walking the perimeter, you notice some trainees setting up some targets, some civilians digging new burrows, and a pickup game of Acornball. You mold targets out of dirt for the trainees, make a hole for the burrowers, and straighten up the Acornball court. Someone tips you 1 amber.

**If the result is 15 or more:** Walking the perimeter, you notice some trainees setting up some targets, some civilians digging new burrows, and a pick up game of Acornball. You mold targets out of dirt for the trainees, make a hole for the burrowers, and straighten up the Acornball court. Someone tips you 1 amber. Gain 1 Virtue.

## 2. Decide what to do next

You are super distracted. You have tasks to do, but you want to relax. You can choose to do the tasks or relax instead.

If you decide to do your tasks, meet up with Tak and do tasks \#2 (Clean Training Grounds) and \#3 (Haul Supplies) with him on the main page. Roll separately for Tak and Rut, and use the higher roll for both these tasks. You then skip \#3 and \#4 below.

If you decide to relax instead, you continue “patrolling”. First, go back to the main page and do tasks \#2 (Clean Training Grounds) and \#3 (Haul Supplies) as Tak, and then come back here. Continue on this page and do tasks \#3 and \#4 below as Rut.

## 3. Relax in the Shade

Reminder: If you chose to do the assigned tasks with Tak on the main page, skip this step. If you chose to relax instead, continue.

You stop patrolling to relax in the shade. When Sergeant Furfoot walks by, you may stand at attention or hide from him.

If you stand at attention, he asks you why you didn’t do your other tasks. You tell him you wanted to take a break. He reprimands you and tells you to get back to patrolling.

If you hide from him, [roll d20 + Dexterity]. Reminder: Earth Molder

**If the result is 12 or less:** Sergeant Furfoot finds you slacking off and reprimands you. “Get back to work, recruit!” He slaps you with his sword. Reduce your health by 1. Gain a -2 penalty to your next roll on this page.

**If the result is 13 or more:** You successfully hide from Sergeant Furfoot, who must still think you’re out on patrol. Gain a +2 bonus to your next roll on this page.

## 4. Continue Patrolling

Reminder: If you chose to do the assigned tasks with Tak on the main page, skip this step. If you chose to take a break, continue.

You get up out of the shade and go for a quick jog around the perimeter. If you scan the area as you go, [roll d20 + Wisdom]

**If the result is 7 or below:** You don’t notice anything, not even the roots on the ground. You trip and fall. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is between 8 and 14:** You don’t notice anything, but have a nice relaxing run.

**If the result is 15 or more:** While running, you notice a nice shady spot with lots of scenery. You take a nap. Restore 1 health.

# Wednesday, January 3, 2024

You get back to patrol by yourself. It’s not long before a lady approaches you. “Hey, patrol person. Can you help me find my son? He ran off into the woods and I’m worried about his safety.” She tells you his name and you go in the direction she says he went.

=======

## Area A – The Clearing

As you go into the forest, you call out for the boy, [roll d20 + Charisma]:

**If the result is 10 or less:** You hear no response.

**If the result is 11 or more:** The boy calls back to you. Gain a +2 bonus to all rolls on this page.

## Area B – The Cave

You peek into the dark cave. You don’t see any signs of the boy, but you do hear a strange scurrying sound. You stop to investigate. [You may explore further before returning here.]

## Area C – The Forest

You go back into the forest. If you scan the trees to see if he’s in one, [roll d20 + Wisdom].

**If the result is 10 or less:** You don’t find him.

**If the result is between 11 and 14:** You don’t find him, but you find a stray piece of amber. Gain 1 amber.

**If the result is 15 or more:** You find him! He was hiding in the trees. You help him get down safely, and escort him back to the clearing. The boy is with you for the rest of the page.

## Area D – The River

You go to the river. Its loud roar is relaxing.

If the boy isn’t with you, you look but don’t find the boy.

You look in the river and find a toy floating downstream. The riverbed is made of dirt. If you wade into the river to grab it, [roll a d20 + Dexterity]. Reminder: Earth Molder

**If the result is 8 or less:** The river carries the toy downstream faster than you can grab it. You slip on your way out. Reduce your health by 2. If the boy is with you, he starts crying.

**If the result is between 9 and 12:** The river carries the toy downstream faster than you can grab it. If the boy is with you, he starts crying.

**If the result is 13 or more:** You quickly grab the toy before it gets away. If the boy is with you, you hand it to him and he happily plays with it in the dirt.

If the boy is not with you, and you got the toy, gain a +2 bonus to all rolls on this page, and give the toy to him if you find him. You may explore and resolve area A and area C one more time each.

# Thursday, January 4, 2024

A loud screech sound echoes from the cave.

If the boy isn’t with you, he runs out of his hiding spot and hides behind you.

The boy follows closely behind you, ears intently trained on the screeching sound, scared expression on his face.

Before investigating the noise, you try to shoo the boy away, but he insists on following you. So you investigate the cave, with him close behind.

When you investigate the cave, you see tiny glowing red eyes. You hear another screech.

1.  Recall info about the red eyes. [roll d20 + Intellect]
2.  Decide how to react:

2A. Bellow at the creatures to scare them. [roll d20 + Strength]

2B. Seal up the cave entrance. [roll d20 + Constitution]

2C. Charge at the creatures. [roll d20 + Dexterity]

=======

## 1. Recall info about the red eyes. [roll d20 + Intellect]

You try to remember if you’ve heard of anything like this. [roll d20 + Intellect]

**If the result is 7 or less**: You don’t recall seeing or hearing anything like this before. By the time you realize they aren’t friendly, they’re already on top of you. Gain a -2 penalty to your next roll (\#2 below).

**If the result is between 8 and 14:** You remember something about them, and realize they’re not friendly.

**If the result is 15 or more:** You recognize them immediately as insects, and remember that they’re a major threat. Gain a +2 bonus to your next roll (\#2 below).

## 2. Decide how to react

Upon recognizing them as a threat, you decide to take action. You can bellow to scare them off, seal off the cave entrance, or charge at them.

### 2.A. Bellow at the creatures to scare them. [roll d20 + Strength]

You take in a deep breath, getting ready to scream at the top of your lungs.

**If the result is 9 or less:** Your scream fails to impress them, and they continue charging towards you.

**If the result is between 10 and 16:** Your scream gives them pause, and one of them drops something before continuing to charge at you. Add 1 Warding Ointment to your inventory.

**If the result is between 17 or more:** Your scream scares them. One of them drops something that you pick up. Add 1 Warding Ointment to your inventory. The enemies all have the Frightened condition on tomorrow’s page: you may reroll their attack value and take the lower amount.

### 2.B. Seal up the cave entrance. [roll d20 + Constitution] Reminder: Earth Molder

Using your earth bending powers, you create stalagmites and stalactites to seal up the cave entrance, trapping them inside. This process takes time, which gives the enemies time to run at you and throw spears at you.

**If the result is 11 or less:** The enemies are too fast. They slip through before you can seal it off, catching you off guard. Enemies get +2 to their defense value on tomorrow’s page. Reduce your health by 2.

**If the result is between 12 and 18:** You seal up the cave entrance to keep most enemies at bay, but some of the enemies are just fast enough to slip through before you can. The ones that got through approach you. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is 19 or more:** You seal up the cave entrance fast enough to lock all the enemies in. But now you hear a scratching sound, and recognize that they’re digging through to come out. When they do, they all come out of one small hole, making it easy to block their attacks. Gain a +2 bonus to all defense rolls on tomorrow’s page.

### 2.C. Charge at the creatures. [roll d20 + Dexterity]

You try to take the battle away from the boy. You give a battle cry, lower your antlers, and charge full force into the enemies, aiming for the first one. While you charge, the enemies throw spears at you.

**If the result is 8 or less:** During your charge, you take several spear wounds. Reduce your health by 3. You miss the first enemy, and find yourself in the middle of several enemies. Gain a -2 penalty to all your attack rolls on tomorrow’s page.

**If the result is between 9 and 14:** During your charge, you take a few spear wounds. Reduce your health by 2. You then hit the first enemy and shove it back. Gain a +5 bonus to your first attack roll on tomorrow’s page.

**If the result is 15 or more:** During your charge, you take a spear wound. Reduce your health by 1. You then hit the first enemy, piercing right through its exoskeleton with your antler tines. Gain a +10 to your first attack roll on tomorrow’s page, and a +5 bonus to all other attack rolls on tomorrow’s page.

# Friday, January 5, 2024

The enemy insects approach you, and you engage in battle.

=======

## Combat

Use the instructions, enemy stats, and amber collection rules on the main page, but play it as Rut battling the insects in the cave instead of Tak battling insects in a tunnel.

Remember to apply any modifiers from yesterday. As a reminder:

If you tried to scare the insects (\#2A) and succeeded (17 or more), all the insects gain the Frightened condition, and you may reroll their attack values and take the lower amount.

If you tried to seal the cave entrance (\#2B) and failed (11 or less), all the insects gain a +2 bonus to all their defense values on this page.

If you tried to seal the cave entrance (\#2B) and succeeded (19 or more), you gain a +2 bonus to all your defense rolls on this page.

If you tried charging at the insects (\#2C) and succeeded (15 or more), you gain a +10 bonus to your first attack roll on this page, and a +5 bonus to all other attack rolls on this page.

## Post-Combat

After the battle is over, if you are still alive, the enemies retreat back into the cave. Collect amber as instructed on the main page. You hand the boy back to his mother, who gives you 1 amber for saving him from the insects. Note “Boy Saved” somewhere for future reference.

If you die, the enemies rush out of the cave and attack the little boy. If you have “Team Synergy” written down from earlier, or if Tak has “High Alert” written down from earlier, someone nearby hears the commotion and fends off the enemies; and then the mother uses a Health Potion on you. If not, then the enemies capture the little boy and he disappears, and you note “Missing Boy” somewhere for future reference.

# Saturday, January 6

You escort the mother and the boy back to their burrow, and then report to Sg Furfoot.

If you both survived the journey and made it to Crownspire City, both you and Tak may take a rest.

# Monday, January 8 – Kindle Thymestew – Fire Starter (Rat)

This week you will playing as Kindle Thymestew, the Fire Starter.

Kindle Thymestew was born with a knack for starting fires, being quite the troublesome arsonist in her youth. Until one day someone introduced her to cooking, which gave her a constructive outlet for her fire powers. Over time she grew quite adept at cooking food to the exact right temperature, and eventually gained employment in the Crownspire royal kitchen as a stew brewer.

She briefly attended the Academy of Elementary Arts, where she originally met Thatch Springwillow. They eventually became coworkers, and now they help each other out on a regular basis. Thatch delivers her fresh ingredients, and she helps him tend to his plants. However, things have gotten stressful in the kitchen lately with the Turning Leaf festival approaching, and she hasn’t had time to visit him and the tree lately.

### 1. Filling the pots. [roll d20 + Strength]

You take each pot to the sink one at a time and fill it about three-quarters full of water.
