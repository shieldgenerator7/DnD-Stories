Heads up: my custom character is probably going to be a species not listed in the calendar, and its probably going to have custom abilities, so things might get wild later on xD

The dates listed are for the events that happened on that day’s calendar page, and not necessarily the date that I wrote the entry. I don’t always update the story everyday.

# Chapter 1 – Tak Redwind

======= 2024-01-01 =======

Tak Redwind stood proudly on the ceremonial stump, beaming with pride at each blue sigil he earned.

“You’ve done well, and proven that you have what it takes to be a Wrenwood guard.” The camp chief held up a slice of an acorn, coated in amber. “You’ve earned this acorn badge. Wear it proudly.”

Tak stood at attention. “I will.”

The graduation ceremony concluded. Of the dozen or so recruits in his class, Tak was the top student, not only showing the highest aptitude in wind bending, but also lifting his classmates up (literally) to help them achieve to the best of their abilities.

Tak was assigned to the burrows as a patrol guard. He was given a day to travel. Thanks to his wind ability, he was able to get himself and the two other newly appointed guards with the same assignment to the burrows in half the time allotted to him. The other new guards convinced him to get to know the area a bit better, and have some fun.

“Sure.” Tak shrugged. He wandered around for a bit, and found a downed tree. Squirrels, beavers, and foxes gathered around it, cutting it into pieces. Tak picked up an axe laying on the ground. “What are we doing here?”

The beaver said that they’re cutting the tree down for lumber, and that they could use help getting the leafy branches off, which they have to do before they can cut the wood into sections.

“Stand back.” Tak ordered.

The animals gasped in anticipation of what he would do. They recognized the symbols that adorned his coat, and knew what they meant. Not many people earned such symbols.

Tak stood at the base of the tree, and swung the axe towards the branches. He called upon the wind to blow the axe through branches, pruning them cleanly off the tree. The axe landed in the dirt just beyond.

The animals all clapped and cheered, as a whole hour of work was completed in just a few seconds.

“Get me another axe.” Tak held out his hand.

A fox handed him another axe, and he did it again. The animals helped him prune the tree for about an hour or so, in which time he almost completely pruned the branches from the tree. Then his new guard buddies heard all the cheering and came over to see.

“Tak! What are you doing?”

“I’m helping the people of the burrow.”

“No! You’re wasting the one chance you have to let loose before official duty. Come on!”

His buddies dragged him to the waterfall, where they played in the water.

Suddenly one of them noticed something shiny in the water. “Hey look an amber! First one there gets it!”

Tak raced his two buddies for the amber, using his wind powers to get there swiftly. It wasn’t even close. He picked it up and held it proudly. He reached out to hand it to the friend who spotted it. “Here.”

The buddy took it, and held it like a badge. “You’ve raced well, proving your worth as a Wrenwood guard.” The buddy said, imitating their camp chief’s voice. “You’ve earned this 1 amber. Spend it wisely.” They all laughed as he placed it on Tak’s fur.

They all went to get some food, and Tak went to a shop to buy a combat tonic.

“What did you go and buy that for?” His buddy giggled.

“You said spend it wisely, so I went and got something that’ll aid in my duties.”

His buddies laughed. “Tak, of course you would.”

“Lighten up man, we got time.” His buddy slapped him on the shoulder. “Here, have some soup.”

Tak sat down and ate the soup.

Tak and his buddies reported to the command post.

“Tak Redwind reporting for duty.”

“Ah, Tak Redwind.” Sergeant Furfoot addressed him. “I heard you cut down a tree yesterday.”

“No, sir, I was merely just…”

“He sure did!” His buddy interjected.

“Very impressive, for a squirrel.” Sg Furfoot commented. “Let’s see if you can patrol just as easily.” Sg Furfoot assigned them each to different sections of the burrow.

Tak patrolled his area for an hour, but didn’t see anything suspicious. He did, however, find another piece of amber.

After an hour or so, Sg Furfoot found him. “Report.”

“Nothing unusual, sir.”

“Very well. I want to see you in action myself. So if there’s nothing out here to do, I have a task for you.”

“Yes, sir.”

Sg Furfoot led Tak to the site where the tree had been just yesterday. There were branches and leaves strewn everywhere.

“Clean this place up. Put everything in a pile over there.”

“Yes, sir!” Tak immediately got to work, creating a cyclone. It surrounded a mess of twigs, shrinking around them and pulling them into a pile. Then he moved the cyclone to the designated pile spot, pulling the twigs with it. He did this for the remaining loose assortment of leaves and twigs. After that was cleared, he picked up 3 amber he found on the ground. Then he focused on the heavier debris. He pulled it himself, using the wind to give him strength. When he was finished, the brush was all in a neat pile.

“Very impressive, indeed.” Sg Furfoot commended.

“Just doing my duty, sir.” Tak stood at attention.

“But that’s not all. The composting pile is over there. Go take this pile to the compost. You can use this wagon. When you’re done, get back on patrol.”

“Yes, sir.” Tak very easily loaded the wagon and took the brush to the compost.

His buddy happened to be patrolling by as he arrived. “Oh man, Tak! They got you doing dump duty?”

“I’m happy doing any duty they need me to.”

“You, happy? That’s the first I’m hearing of this!” His buddy laughed.

Tak unloaded the brush into the compost pile and went back to patrol the perimeter.
