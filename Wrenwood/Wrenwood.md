# Leaf Riders of Wrenwood

Story about the page-a-day quest calendar from Sundial Games. It’s about what happened in my playthrough. You can get the game here:  
https://sundialgamesllc.itch.io/2024-quest-calendar

Heads up: my custom character is probably going to be a species not listed in the calendar, and its probably going to have custom abilities, so things might get wild later on xD

The dates listed are for the events that happened on that day’s calendar page, and not necessarily the date that I wrote the entry. I don’t always update the story everyday.

# 0 – House Rules

Here are the custom rules I’m playing with.

## Scavenging instead of Pickpocketing

If the page has a Pickpocket symbol, but also has a task in which you could reasonably find loose amber laying around, you may choose to scavenge instead of pickpocketing to avoid losing virtue on a roll of 4.

This supplements pg19 of the rules.

## Difficulty Setting – Hard Mode

"Make each roll in a round and decide whether to use an ability before making the next roll." -Rules pg15

## Retroactive Boon Usage

When you get a boon, you may immediately apply it to a previous d20 result rolled on the same page, as long as it follows Schroedinger's Rule (ie you cant add it to a previous roll that would cause you to not get the boon in the first place).

This supplements pg26 of the rules.

## Schroedinger's Rule

Anything in the past that did not significantly influence the present can be retroactively changed.

# Chapter 1 – Tak Redwind

======= 2024-01-01 =======

Tak Redwind stood proudly on the ceremonial stump, beaming with pride at each blue sigil he earned.

“You’ve done well, and proven that you have what it takes to be a Wrenwood guard.” The camp chief held up a slice of an acorn, coated in amber. “You’ve earned this acorn badge. Wear it proudly.”

Tak stood at attention. “I will.”

The graduation ceremony concluded. Of the dozen or so recruits in his class, Tak was the top student, not only showing the highest aptitude in wind bending, but also lifting his classmates up (literally) to help them achieve to the best of their abilities.

Tak was assigned to the burrows as a patrol guard. He was given a day to travel. Thanks to his wind ability, he was able to get himself and the two other newly appointed guards with the same assignment to the burrows in half the time allotted to him. The other new guards convinced him to get to know the area a bit better, and have some fun.

“Sure.” Tak shrugged. He wandered around for a bit, and found a downed tree. Squirrels, beavers, and foxes gathered around it, cutting it into pieces. Tak picked up an axe laying on the ground. “What are we doing here?”

The beaver said that they’re cutting the tree down for lumber, and that they could use help getting the leafy branches off, which they have to do before they can cut the wood into sections.

“Stand back.” Tak ordered.

The animals gasped in anticipation of what he would do. They recognized the symbols that adorned his coat, and knew what they meant. Not many people earned such symbols.

Tak stood at the base of the tree, and swung the axe towards the branches. He called upon the wind to blow the axe through branches, pruning them cleanly off the tree. The axe landed in the dirt just beyond.

The animals all clapped and cheered, as a whole hour of work was completed in just a few seconds.

“Get me another axe.” Tak held out his hand.

A fox handed him another axe, and he did it again. The animals helped him prune the tree for about an hour or so, in which time he almost completely pruned the branches from the tree. Then his new guard buddies heard all the cheering and came over to see.

“Tak! What are you doing?”

“I’m helping the people of the burrow.”

“No! You’re wasting the one chance you have to let loose before official duty. Come on!”

His buddies dragged him to the waterfall, where they played in the water.

Suddenly one of them noticed something shiny in the water. “Hey look an amber! First one there gets it!”

Tak raced his two buddies for the amber, using his wind powers to get there swiftly. It wasn’t even close. He picked it up and held it proudly. He reached out to hand it to the friend who spotted it. “Here.”

The buddy took it, and held it like a badge. “You’ve raced well, proving your worth as a Wrenwood guard.” The buddy said, imitating their camp chief’s voice. “You’ve earned this 1 amber. Spend it wisely.” They all laughed as he placed it on Tak’s fur.

They all went to get some food, and Tak went to a shop to buy a combat tonic.

“What did you go and buy that for?” His buddy giggled.

“You said spend it wisely, so I went and got something that’ll aid in my duties.”

His buddies laughed. “Tak, of course you would.”

“Lighten up man, we got time.” His buddy slapped him on the shoulder. “Here, have some soup.”

Tak sat down and ate the soup.

======= 2024-01-02 =======

Tak and his buddies reported to the command post.

“Tak Redwind reporting for duty.”

“Ah, Tak Redwind.” Sergeant Furfoot addressed him. “I heard you cut down a tree yesterday.”

“No, sir, I was merely just…”

“He sure did!” His buddy interjected.

“Very impressive, for a squirrel.” Sg Furfoot commented. “Let’s see if you can patrol just as easily.” Sg Furfoot assigned them each to different sections of the burrow.

Tak patrolled his area for an hour, but didn’t see anything suspicious. He did, however, find another piece of amber.

After an hour or so, Sg Furfoot found him. “Report.”

“Nothing unusual, sir.”

“Very well. I want to see you in action myself. So if there’s nothing out here to do, I have a task for you.”

“Yes, sir.”

Sg Furfoot led Tak to the site where the tree had been just yesterday. There were branches and leaves strewn everywhere.

“Clean this place up. Put everything in a pile over there.”

“Yes, sir!” Tak immediately got to work, creating a cyclone. It surrounded a mess of twigs, shrinking around them and pulling them into a pile. Then he moved the cyclone to the designated pile spot, pulling the twigs with it. He did this for the remaining loose assortment of leaves and twigs. After that was cleared, he picked up 3 amber he found on the ground. Then he focused on the heavier debris. He pulled it himself, using the wind to give him strength. When he was finished, the brush was all in a neat pile.

“Very impressive, indeed.” Sg Furfoot commended.

“Just doing my duty, sir.” Tak stood at attention.

“But that’s not all. The composting pile is over there. Go take this pile to the compost. You can use this wagon. When you’re done, get back on patrol.”

“Yes, sir.” Tak very easily loaded the wagon and took the brush to the compost.

His buddy happened to be patrolling by as he arrived. “Oh man, Tak! They got you doing dump duty?”

“I’m happy doing any duty they need me to.”

“You, happy? That’s the first I’m hearing of this!” His buddy laughed.

Tak unloaded the brush into the compost pile and went back to patrol the perimeter.

======= 2024-01-03 =======

Tak went back to his patrol, but was stopped by Sg Furfoot. He told him that group of diggers needed help removing overgrown roots from an old burrow, and that Tak would be great at the job because he was good at pruning the downed tree. Sg Furfoot handed him an axe and shoved Tak towards the hole.

Tak jumped in, landing with a soft thud and woosh. Wind blew past the other critters at the base.

“Are you the one here to help us?”

“Yes. What can I help you with?” Tak stood up.

“Aren’t you the one who chopped the tree up yesterday?"

“That was me.”

“Oh we’re saved!” The critters cheered. “These roots are so tough, we thought we’d never get through them. But with your help, we’ll clear them in no time.”

Tak stood proudly. “I will do my best. Now, show me to the roots.”

They lead him to the bunker, where they show him the dense roots.

“See? The roots are all underneath the beds.” They shake the beds, showing how unstable they are. “We can’t jump on them like this!”

Tak goes into the room alone.

The other critters stand back. “Go on, do your thing. We’ll just watch from out here.”

“What are you doing? Aren’t you going to help?” Tak looked back.

“No, we don’t want to get hit by your axe. Show us your awesome moves!”

Tak wrinkled his nose. “Ok.” He picked up his axe and swung it at the roots, hardly scratching them. He swung again, summoning all the wind power he could muster, which was none at all. His command of the wind wasn’t working on in this tunnel, where the air was stagnant. He swung the axe into the root, and it got stuck. The handle broke when he tried pulling it out.

“Boo! Show us your wind powers!”

Sweat dripped on Tak’s brow. “Uh… how about in the next room?”

The critters agreed. They took Tak to the next room, where roots were crawling over storage containers. Some had been here so long the roots grew over them, causing them to be sealed shut.

“Ok, now show us!”

Tak spied a young root that looked easy to break. He held up his spear and, while taking in a big deep breath, threw the spear at the root as he blew with his mouth. His own breath was enough to give his spear just enough speed to splinter the root and lodge itself in the wall beyond. A rotting container being held shut by the root fell open, and a warding ointment fell out.

The critters cheered! “That was awesome! Again! Again!”

Tak smiled proudly. “Ok, but you need to blow with me. Stand behind me, take in a deep breath, and when I throw the spear, blow as hard as you can. Got it?”

The critters all nodded. They did exactly what Tak told them, and he gained a lot of wind power to throw his spear. Their blowing was just enough to give him the power he needed. He threw his spear again and again, freeing up all the containers. It took over an hour, but he did it.

He wiped his brow, exhausted. He picked up the warding ointment that had fallen out of the crate. “Good work, critters. Now it’s time to head home.”

“No, wait, can you also help us get into our stash? There was a cave in and some of our valuables got lost in it.”

“Ok.” Tak agreed.

They took him to the cave in. They worked together to clear the rubble, and after a while, they were able to go in again.

“Yay! Our treasure!” They cheered. “Here, here’s some amber for you. Thank you so much!”

“I’m just doing my duty.” Tak held his chin high.

Suddenly, a scratching sound came from below.

“Another tremor?” A critter asked, worriedly. “Run!” The critters ran out, climbing out of the hole.

“What?” Tak asked.

“It’s a tremor! Like the one that caused the collapse of the treasure room!”

Tak decided to investigate instead. He followed the noise to an empty room.

======= 2024-01-04 =======

The ground shook, and crumbled. Tak noticed in time, and jumped to the side. “Ah!”

Then the noise stopped and the ground settled. Tak peered over the edge of the hole. He didn’t see anything, because it was too dark. So he closed his eyes and listened. There was a scurrying sound from down below.

“Hello? Anyone down there?” Tak called out.

There was no answer, except a light breeze blowing down into the pit.

“A breeze?” Tak smiled. He called down into the pit, “Don’t worry, I’m coming for you.”

Tak jumped into the pit, softening his landing with his wind powers. A wave of wind washed over the rocks beneath him, clearing him a little landing pad.

======= 2024-01-05 =======

He stood up, and listened. His ears twitched forward. The scurrying was moving away from him.

“Hello? I’m here to help get you out.” He walked closer, and the scurrying stopped. “Come here.”

Then two little red dots appeared in front of him. Then another pair of red dots.

SCREEEEEECH

Tak could barely make out their forms, but could tell they were not mammals, but rather some kind of giant arthropod, potentially ants.

One of the ants lunged at him with its mandibles wide open.

Tak swung his spear at it, and it landed on the spear, impaling itself.

Before Tak could get the spear out of it, the next ant flanked him and screeched.

Tak blocked the ant with the dead ant’s body, trying to stab it in the process. The ant dodged, and came up behind him.

Tak quickly drank a combat tonic while keeping the second ant away. Now feeling the adrenaline, he pulled really hard and got his spear out of the first ant. He swung around just in time to block the second ant.

It pressed up against his spear handle, trying desperately to nibble on his face.

Tak took in a deep breath, and when he exhaled, he blew the ant away from him. The ant slammed against the wall, hitting its head bad on a rocky spike.

It just had a concussion, it moved to get back up.

Tak exhaled as he threw his spear, sending it straight into the ant’s thorax, killing it instantly.

A third ant stood off in the distance, throwing spikes at Tak.

He nimbly dodged them as he retrieved his spear. Then he threw his spear all the way down the tunnel, piercing straight through its exoskeleton.

All sorts of skittering and scurrying moved down the tunnel away from him.

He breathed a sigh of relief. He examined his injuries. Luckily, he had none. Not even a scratch. But, he was exhausted. He found 3 amber among the ant corpses.

======= 2024-01-06 =======

He walked down the tunnel, following the breeze. He picked up his spear and used it as a walking stick. After a few minutes of walking, he found a tunnel that led up to the surface. He climbed up, almost losing his grip. That’s when he smelled it: the awful smell of the compost pile.

“Hey! Help!” Tak called out.

It wasn’t long before a familiar voice called back. “Hey, Tak, is that you?” It was his buddy!

“It’s me. Can you help me out here?”

“Sure thing, buddy.” His buddy helped him out of the pit. “Where’ve you been? There’s rumors you were crushed in a cave-in.”

“It feels like it.” Tak brushed himself off. “Where’s the sergeant? I’ve got urgent news.”

His buddy took him to the sergeant and spread the word that he was safe.

Tak told Sg Furfoot about his encounter with the ants.

“This is very serious indeed.” Sg Furfoot pondered. “You must warn the council at the Crownspire City, right away. Ask to meet with High Guard Captain Flint Clawthorn, he’ll know what to do.”

“Yes, sir!”

“Tak, you’re tired.” His buddy protested. “You should rest.”

“It’s my duty.”

His buddy sighed. “Ok, if you’re going, I’m coming with you.” His buddy handed him a sage leaf. “Here, you need this more than I do.” He laughed.

Tak and his buddy left the burrow to go to Crownspire City. Tak used his wind powers to speed them up when he could, but he was too exhausted to keep it up.

======= 2024-01-07 =======

Along the way, he accidentally dropped 2 amber in his haste.
