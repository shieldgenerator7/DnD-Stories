# Leaf Riders of Wrenwood Side Quest Calendar

This side quest calendar is fan content designed to work with the 2024 Quest Calendar by Sundial Games. You can get it here:  
<https://sundialgamesllc.itch.io/2024-quest-calendar>

This side quest calendar follows fan-created characters, but includes canon characters. Starting out, you’ll be playing Rut Quakehoof, a deer earth bender.

There will be no hidden symbols here, so refer to the main calendar for finding the hidden symbols. If the main calendar has a hidden symbol on a day, you can use that same hidden symbol in this side quest calendar.

## How to Use

At the start of the day, do this side quest calendar first, as it may override what you do on the main calendar page. The main calendar page follows the main character, and this side quest calendar follows a supporting character. The two characters can interact with each other and effect each other’s rolls and results.

It’s a good idea to record your rolls for ability checks. Sometimes they’re mentioned in a future page. If you don’t remember what you rolled, assume you rolled a 2.

Start the side quest calendar with the following character, Rut Quakehoof.

# 01 – January

## Rut Quakehoof – Earth Molder (Deer)

Naturally talented at earth bending, he passed his classes at the Academy of Elemental Arts with flying colors. He crushed his competition, making them eat his dust. He got away with doing less than his best work, so he barely tries. He likes to hang out and relax, and thought that guard duty was a perfect opportunity to do just that.

Tak Redwind and him are buddies, but he annoys Tak with his persistent unwillingness to put in any effort. And Tak annoys him with his incessant encouragement and optimism.

He was assigned to The Burrows, traveling there with Tak from Crownspire City after graduation.

2.  Explore all the areas of the outpost in any order you desire.

=======

While The Burrow is primarily a military outpost and training ground, several civilian facilities and acommodations exist to create a small-town atmosphere.

There are many enticing smells and sounds that catch your interest.

### 1. Convince Tak to explore with you. [roll d20 + Charisma]

“Hey, Tak, we’ve been traveling for a long time. Let’s take a break and have some fun.”

If you are also playing Tak, you may choose to automatically roll either a 2 or 19.

**If the result is 14 or less:** Tak shakes his head and wanders off on his own. “There’s work to be done here, we’ve got to help out the best we can.”

**If the result is 15 or more:** Tak shrugs and follows along. “I am pretty tired after that journey. I could use a little break. But right after we report to the sergeant, ok?”

### 2. Explore all the areas of the outpost in any order you desire.

Options include: Waterfall, Acornball Court, Cooking Site, Bunker

If Tak is with you, he doesn’t explore the Fallen Tree or Supply Post areas from his page.

### Waterfall

If Tak is with you, you may choose to do his Waterfall challenge first. If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, he happens to meet you here, and is with you for this area.

At the Waterfall, you find several people relaxing in the hot springs behind the falls. The walls of the spring are made of hardened dirt. They welcome you to come sit with them. If you do, [roll d20 + Constitution]. Reminder: Earth Molder

**If the result is 8 or less:** As you sit down, you sit on a sharp rock. They laugh at you. Reduce your health by 1.

Some civilians have set up an area in a patch of dirt to play Acornball. They need another player to join their team, and invite you. If you join their Acornball team, [roll d20 + Dexterity]. Reminder: Earth Molder

If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, you convince him to join your team, and he is with you for this area. If Tak is with you, you gain a +2 bonus to this roll.

**If the result is 8 or less:** You get hit in the face with an acorn and your team loses. Reduce your health by 1.

**If the result is between 9 and 16:** You play and have lots of fun. Your team loses, but you’re a good sport about it and everyone had fun.

**If the result is 17 or more:** You score the final point and your team wins! You find 1 amber buried in the dirt. If Tak is with you, you may give the 1 amber to him instead. Note down “Team Synergy” somewhere for future reference.

### Cooking Site

After all that activity, you sure are hungry. You find a bustling area at the cooking site filled with delicious aromas. People are busy preparing meals or volunteering to lend a hand. If you would like to help with distributing meals, [roll d20 + Strength]. Reminder: Earth Molder

**If the result is 8 or less:** You spill the food, creating a mess. The head cook tells you to sit down.

**If the result is between 9 and 12:** You distribute the food, but you get in the way of other people.

**If the result is 13 or more:** You distribute the food easily and efficiently. The head cook gives you 1 amber for saving him so much time.

You then sit down to enjoy your meal.

If Tak is not with you, you may [roll d20 + Charisma]. If the result is 15 or higher, he happens to meet you here, and is with you for this area.

If Tak is with you, and you are playing Tak, remember what you rolled for the d20 + Wisdom roll. If Tak succeeded on this roll (11 or more), then restore 1 health. If Tak failed this roll (10 or less), then your food does not smell appetizing. If you eat it anyway, [roll d20 + Constitution].

**If the result is between 11 and 14:** The food tastes bad, but you eat it anyway. You tell Tak that it’s not so bad. “Thanks, I might pick this up as a hobby,” Tak says. Your ears pin back as you try to smile.

**If the result is 15 or more:** You swallow it whole and barely notice the taste. You give Tak a big thumbs up. Restore 1 health.

## Tuesday, January 2, 2024

You stand at attention before Sergeant Furfoot as he gives you a list of your duties for the day. “Listen up, Rut. As a new member of The Burrows, you have much to prove. I have some important jobs for you to handle today.”

Do all the tasks:

“I need you to patrol the outer perimeter of The Burrows. Keep an eye out for any signs of intruders or suspicious activity. Report back immediately if you spot anything out of the ordinary.”

On patrol, you find the compost pile before too long. It stinks like rotten eggs in an outhouse.

**If the result is 7 or less:** You quickly walk the perimeter, trying to observe the grounds beyond. With it being your first day, you aren’t sure what constitutes unusual activity, except for maybe the unusual smell of the compost pile. You report this to Sg Furfoot, but he is not amused. “Stop getting distracted, Rut,” he reprimands you.

**If the result is between 8 and 14:** Walking the perimeter, you notice some trainees setting up some targets, some civilians digging new burrows, and a pickup game of Acornball.

You get up out of the shade and go for a quick jog around the perimeter. You scan the area as you go, [roll d20 + Wisdom]

## Thursday, January 4, 2024

A loud screech sound echoes from the cave. If the boy isn’t with you, he runs out of his hiding spot and hides behind you.

Before investigating the noise, you try to shoo the boy away, but he insists on following you. So you investigate the cave, with him close behind.
