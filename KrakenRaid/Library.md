## Seeker™ Spell Ring

This ring contains 1 spell slot with which you can cast a spell you know of that level or lower. It recharges after a long rest.

## Boots of Speed

\+30 speed

You may use your reaction to use your unexpended movement during another creature’s turn. If you do, this movement doesn’t provoke attack of opportunity.

For each 5ft you move, you gain 1 momentum stack.

Your next melee attack uses all momentum stacks to gain a +1 bonus to hit for each momentum stack. Additionally, if this attack hits, it deals additional force damage equal to 1d4 per momentum stack.

You can have a maximum number of momentum stacks equal to 10 + your Dexterity.

## Abyssal Seal

As an action, touch the seal to a creature within 5ft of you. They must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be banished to the abyssal plane. For every 10% missing health the creature has, the DC increases by 1. Unconscious creatures automatically fail this saving throw. Creatures banished with this seal cannot re-enter the plane they were banished from unless the seal is broken.

Breaking this seal does not automatically bring creatures banished with it back to this plane. If this seal is moved to another plane, its existing effects end on any and all creatures it effected.

## Abyssal Anchor

Melee weapon

When you successfully hit a creature with this anchor, they must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving or be branded with the abyssal mark. The brand prevents them from escaping the abyssal plane.

## Shell of Pocket Imprisonment

Thrown Weapon

When you hit a creature with this item, it contains them in a pocket dimension, from which they cannot escape on their own.

## Astalir’s Hat

While wearing this hat, you may freely cast Alter Self.

Additionally, as an action, you may create a clone of yourself within 5ft of you. The clone has the same amount of hit points as you do. The clone can do all things you can do, expending your spell slots and ability charges as necessary. The clone has a duplicate of all items you have, except its copies are nonmagical. You can control the clone using a free action.

If you become unconscious, you return to your original form and all clones made by this hat disappear.

The clones have a range of 120ft from you, beyond which they disappear.

## Seeker™ Flight Armor

When you are not on the ground, your armor doffs itself and stores itself in a necklace. When you are on the ground, it dons itself onto you over any other clothes you are wearing.

It does not don itself if you are already wearing armor.

# Spells

## True Strike

Divination Cantrip  
1 Bonus Action  
1 minute

As a bonus action, choose a target you can see within 30ft. For 1 minute, you gain a +1 bonus to hit that creature, and you gain +1 crit range against that creature. Casting this on the same creature again stacks and refreshes the duration. Casting this on another creature removes all stacks you have on other creatures.

The maximum stacks you can have on one creature is 10 + your spellcasting ability.

## Armor Shred

1st Level Evocation  
1 Bonus Action  
60ft range, 5ft radius  
1 minute

As a bonus action, target a point within range. A pool of acid spawns with a radius of 10ft.

Creatures in the area take 1d10 acid damage.  
**Saving throw:** Constitution  
**Success:** The creature takes half damage.  
**Failure:** The creature takes full damage. The creature loses AC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier for the duration.

## Nice Save

Abjuration Cantrip  
1 Reaction  
30ft range  
Instantaneous

As a reaction when you or another creature within range must make a saving throw, grant that creature a bonus to their saving throw equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

## Soul Boost

3rd Level Necromancy  
1 Action  
60ft range  
1 hour, Concentration

You shout the name of a willing creature within range. For the duration, that creature gains +X to all their ability scores, Xd10 temporary hit points, a +X bonus to all ability checks and saving throws, +X AC, and a +X bonus to hit, and +X charges of a resource they use (eg Monk Ki points), where X is your spellcasting ability modifier.

Additionally, they don’t fall unconscious when they drop to 0 hit points or less.

When the spell ends, a wave of lethargy sweeps over them, and they lose all charges of the resource gained by this spell. They must make a Constitution saving throw, with a DC equal to your spell save DC plus your spellcasting ability modifier, minus their current hit points (even if they have negative hit points). On a failure, they fall unconscious.

# Items (Enemy)

## Eye of the Kraken

While wearing this pendant, you have Ocean Sense out to a range of 1mi. While in the water, you can sense other creatures in the same body of water or connected body of water within range.

## Horn of the Kraken

This horn sticks out of your skull at an odd angle.

Once per hour, you may telepathically send a message to another creature of your choosing. You must be aware of this creature. The creature does not have to be on the same plane as you.

The creature may respond to you. If they do, then you may have a telepathic conversation for 5 minutes, during which you may see and hear from their point of view.

If the creature doesn't respond within 5 minutes, then you can not attempt to message them again for 24 hours.
