Kraken Raid

Custom Rules and Rulings

# Advantage and Disadvantage

A d20 roll can have both advantage and disadvantage.

When rolling with advantage, roll an additional d20, and drop the lowest.

When rolling with disadvantage, roll an additional d20, and drop the highest.

Using these two rules, you can have a roll with multiple advantages, multiple disadvantages, and any combination of the two.

Example: You’re a rogue who is on the ground within 5ft of an enemy who is blinded. You want to attack it. You have disadvantage because you’re prone, but you have advantage because the enemy is blinded. You decide to bonus action Steady Aim to give you advantage again. So for each advantage/disadvantage, you roll an additional d20, so you roll 4 d20s. You roll:

1, 5, 10, 15

You have 1 disadvantage, so you drop the highest value, 15.

1, 5, 10

You have 2 advantages, so you drop the two lowest values, 1 and 5.

10

Your final roll is 10. Luckily you have a +3 to hit with your dagger, getting a 13 and beating the enemy’s DC of 12. Good job!

# Area of Effect Spells and Cover

Walls and large objects can block area of effect spells from reaching certain squares. This applies to all area of effect spells unless the spell specifically states it spreads around corners.

# Time

I will be keeping track of time in this one shot.

# Opportunity Attack

If a creature is focused on a particular enemy, it cannot opportunity attack an enemy that it is not focusing on.

Additionally, attacks of opportunity are made at disadvantage.

# Grapple Checks

To grapple a creature, make an Athletics check. The creature may make a contested Athletics check or Acrobatics check. If you roll higher, you grapple the creature. If the target rolls higher, you do not grapple the creature. If it is a tie, you grapple the creature, but they get advantage on the next check they make to break free of the grapple.

# Shove Checks

To shove a creature, make an Athletics check. The creature may make a contested Athletics check or Acrobatics check. If you roll higher, you may shove the creature a number of feet away equal to or less than your Strength modifier times 5. If the target rolls higher, you do not shove the creature. If it is a tie, you shove the creature, but they only get shoved up to half the distance, rounded up.

You may only shove a creature the same size as you or smaller.

# Dexterity Saves

When you succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, you may move up to 5ft.

Making an Acrobatics check to avoid being grappled or shoved counts as a Dexterity saving throw for the purposes of this rule.

This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

# Crit Range

By default, every creature has a crit range of 1. This means that they crit an attack roll on a 20 when rolling a d20.

Your crit range determines how many high values on a d20 count as a crit. The amount of high values on a d20 that count as a crit are equal to your crit range.

For example, if your crit range is 3, rolling a 20, 19, or 18 on a d20 count as a crit.

# Wish Spell

The Wish spell may be used to cast other spells. Any other use of the Wish spell may have severe negative repercussions and/or might be monkey paw’d, even if the wish is super specific. Some wishes might be twisted beyond the text of the wish, and some might have no effect whatsoever. Basically, just don’t use this spell.

# Character Death

Characters can die in this one shot. If your character fails its 3rd death saving throw, it is dead. They cannot come back. However, you are allowed to make a new character.

A Total Party Kill (TPK) is a possibility in this one shot.

# Wounds

When a character drops to 0 hit points and fails any death saving throws, they may incur a wound. A wound is a feature that limits your character or adds more risk to using certain features.

For example, if your character falls unconscious from being bitten in the leg, they might have a wound that lowers their movement speed by 5ft.

Obviously, in order for the wound to matter, the character has to first survive falling unconscious, otherwise they’re just dead.

# Actions, Bonus Actions, Reactions, Free Actions

You get 1 action, 1 bonus action, 1 reaction, and 1 free action. These all refresh on the start of your turn.

You may use your action to use a bonus action.

# Resistances & Vulnerabilities

If two or more sources give you resistance to the same damage type, that resistance stacks.

Additionally, vulnerability and absorption can also stack in this manner.

These modifiers are processed in this order:

1.  Absorption
2.  Immunity
3.  Vulnerability
4.  Resistance
