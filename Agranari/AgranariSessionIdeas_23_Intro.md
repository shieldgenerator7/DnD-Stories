# Agranari Session Ideas: 23 Intro

These are session ideas for running the intro to legomike5’s deer character, 23.

# Helping Gra on the Ranch

23 helps Gra do chores on the ranch:

-   Feeding pigs and chickens
-   Cleaning chicken coop
-   Cleaning pig barn
-   Unloading plant food delivery (Delivery / Pickup)
-   Loading up meat food pickup (Delivery / Pickup)
-   Making sacrifices to the cave monster (Sacrifice to the Cave Monster)
-   Finding big pigs
-   Collecting eggs
-   Making breakfast

# Claim a Room

23 needs a place to sleep. The two bedrooms in the house have been cleaned up, but they still need refurbished and redecorated.

# Start B&B

Gra needs help starting up a B&B. 23 can help him come up with ideas and make signs and stuff.

# Delivery / Pickup

A peacock and a bear come with a cart to drop off plant food and pick up meat food.

If 23 still has the wolf “collar”, the peacock will inform Gra that 23 is an escaped “family member” of the wolf village.

# Sacrifice to the Cave Monster

Gra has 23 carry a few pigs into a cave, and tells him where to place them.

# Spiderling Weather

Spiderlings start falling from the sky, consuming anything they can get their mandibles on. It’s up to Gra and 23 to save the pigs and chickens from becoming spider chow! Afterwards, there’s spiders milling about, covering the place in dangerous webs.

Luckily the Howl Force is on the job! This band of wolves is especially equipped to deal with this situation.

Careful tho, as they’re loyal to the wolves first. If they notice 23’s wolf collar, they’ll be likely to report it.

# School

Gra sends 23 to school to learn English. His class is mostly bears and a few peafowl. His teacher is, of course, a deer. There is also 1 or 2 deer classmates.

# Ranch Raid!

The wolves have received reports of an escaped deer living in the bear village, and have come to claim him. They bring their most formidable investigator, who can see up to 73 days into the past. They chase 23 until they capture him.

Gra will try to delay them, but he won’t directly fight them, for he knows the consequences of doing so.

# B&B Business

Gra and 23 run a B&B, with lots of various guests. Their first guest is (maybe) someone he knows from school.

Eventually, they get guests who are from outside town.

# Growing Up

Depending on how long it takes for the wolves to capture him, 23 can live a long time on the farm.

Cut to scenes that show him growing up:

-   First “birthday” on the ranch
-   23 getting his own pig/chicken as a “pet”
-   23 learning how to butcher
-   23’s first crush / relationship
-   Maybe even 23 growing up and moving away
-   23 starting his own ranch?
-   23 taking over as owner / operator of B&B?s
