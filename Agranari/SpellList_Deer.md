# Deer Spell List

These spells take multiple rounds to cast. Once they are cast, they are permanent, until the hoof clipping holding it is broken.

Each spell has a Difficulty attribute ranging from 0 to 100. The higher the number, the harder the spell is to cast. Harder spells take more time to cast and have a shorter range.

Some spells can be bended. This is similar to the “At Higher Levels” section in DnD spells. You choose whether or not to bend the spell when you cast it. Bended spells have greater effects but also greater difficulty, which can go above 100. Each bending option can be chosen more than once on each spell.

Deer spells can be cast on one’s self, or on another creature or object. Spells that refer to “you” in their description can still be cast on other targets, with “you” referring to the target.

For DnD, these spells:

-   Count as being of the Transmutation school of magic (mostly)
-   Are not ritual spells
-   Have a “casting time” equal to their Difficulty
-   Have a range determined by your spell power and the spell’s difficulty
-   Can target any creature / object in range, as applicable
-   Require Somatic components only
-   Are not Concentration
-   Have a duration essentially equal to your hoof durability
-   Have a spellcasting ability of your choice when you create the character (not that it means anything for most spells)

Not all these spell attributes line up perfectly, in terms of how they work mechanically, but it’s what you can write in the sheet to make a reasonable amount of sense.

# Buff Ability Score

Difficulty: 15

Increase one of your ability scores by 1.

Spell Bend

-   (Difficulty +12): Increase the ability score by an additional 1 point.
-   (Difficulty +10): Increase an additional ability score by 1 point.

# Change Appearance

Difficulty: 0

Change slight things about your appearance. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things this spell can do:

-   Change eye color, head/muzzle shape, fur pattern, etc.
-   Remove scars, pimples, birthmarks, etc.
-   Add beauty marks, eyeshadow, stripes, tattoos, etc.

These changes are purely cosmetic and have no impact on your physical abilities.

# Change Species

Difficulty: 50

Requirements: You must have seen the species at least once.

You become a member of another Agranari species. You become a regular-proportioned member of that species with about your same size. Your fur pattern and overall physique stays the same as much as possible.

You gain the stats of your new form, higher or lower, and you gain their physical abilities. However, you don’t automatically adjust to your new form. If you’re not familiar with your new form, you need time to adjust and get experience in it before you can use it to its full effectiveness.

If your new form has a Blemish, make a History check and an Arcana check. If you pass both, your new Blemish is functional and you gain the species ability that comes with the Blemish.

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether or not to bend your Bending Hoof too. If you do bend your Bending Hoof, the hoof clipping immediately falls off.

# Copy Appearance

Difficulty: 25

Change your appearance to mimic that of another individual, who is the same species as you. You must have seen them at least once.
