# Agranari Adventures Custom Rules

These are the custom rules for this campaign.

# Character Creation

## Ability Scores

Roll 1d20 at advantage x1 for each ability score individually. Then, you may reroll 1 ability score. Then, you may swap two ability scores.

## Character Options

The options available to you are slightly different than normal DnD. Here are the options to choose from. Notice that Class isn’t one of them.

### Species

This is essentially your Race, in DnD terms. You can choose from one of the following:

-   Cat
-   Wolf
-   Deer
-   Peacock
-   Beaver
-   Bear
-   Spider

Your species gives you ability score bonuses, background, languages, and extra features. It also determines your hit die.

Each species has its own unique set of backgrounds to choose from, each with their own stat bonuses.

Each species has its own unique stats to roll for, all of which will be recorded privately in the DM’s spreadsheet. These stats effect the effectiveness of the species’ features.

### Background

This is essentially a replacement for Class, but it’s more similar to Background in DnD terms. You choose your background from the list of backgrounds available for your Species. Your background gives you stat bonuses and some extra features.

If there is a certain background that you want that isn’t listed for your species, work with the DM to figure out if that background is available, or if there’s another similar background that is suitable.

### Name

Each species has its own naming conventions. Please follow the naming conventions of the species. If you’re having trouble, you can come up with a name or randomly generate one, and the DM will come up with a name that is similar to the original, but that fits the species.

### Appearance

Your appearance will be determined by your species. You may choose to take the species ability of your chosen species, but if you do, it effects a small part of your appearance. Each species has an “imperfection” that means they have the species ability. If you don’t want the imperfection to be a part of your character’s apearnce, then you can forego taking the species ability.

### Starting Item

It is likely that your character starts with an heirloom of a lost family member, such as a sibling, parent, or grandparent. These items come in many varieties, depending on your starting location and species. Work with your DM to figure out what kind of item you start with.

# Advantage / Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage are reworked to be more flexible. Advantage and Disadvantage will often have a multiplier after it that says how many extra dice to roll, and how many dice to take away. If there is no multiplier specified, it is assumed that the multiplier is 1.

When rolling Advantage x1, roll 1 additional die, and remove the lowest die. Advantage x2: 2 additional dice, remove the lowest 2 dice. This also works for Advantage x3, x4, etc.

When rolling Disdvantage x1, roll 1 additional die, and remove the highest die. Disdvantage x2: 2 additional dice, remove the highest 2 dice. This also works for Disdvantage x3, x4, etc.

This way, Advantage and Disadvantage can be combined in more ways than just canceling each other out, and can be stacked on top of each other.

# Soft AC

You have a Soft AC equal to your AC + Soft AC Bonus. When you take damage from an attack that has to meet your AC to hit, determine whether or not it meets your Soft AC. If it doesn't meet your Soft AC, then you reduce the damage by your Soft AC Damage Reduction.

Example:  
You have an AC of 13, a Soft AC Bonus of 5, and a Soft AC Damage Reduction of 3. Therefore your Soft AC is (13 + 5) = 18. An enemy attacks you with a 15 to hit. It beats your AC, so the attack hits. However, it doesn't meet your Soft AC, so you apply damage reduction. The rolled attack damage is 7, so the damage you take is (7 - 3) = 4.

Most creatures have a Soft AC Bonus of 0, meaning they don’t have any Soft AC.

# On Your Turn

On your turn, as normal, you can take 1 action, 1 bonus action, move, and get your reaction back.

Additionally, you have 1 object interaction action, and 1 free action.

As an action, you can use a feature or spell that normally takes a bonus action.

# Turn Delay

At the start of combat, you may willingly lower your initiative roll. You must keep the new value until end of combat.

# Reaction Turn

There is no longer any “Hold” action. On your turn, if you did not use one or more of your action, bonus action, or movement, you may take your turn “later”.

As a reaction, you may use your action if unused, bonus action if unused, and/or any remaining movement if not fully used.

If you move as part of this reaction, and this reaction is taken in response to another creature moving, you do not provoke Attack of Opportunity from that moving creature with this movement.

# Prone Actions

As a reaction to being targeted by a ranged attack, you may drop prone to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

As a bonus action, you may stand up from being prone without spending any movement.

# Death Saves

When you take damage, you can drop below 0 hitpoints.

If you have 0 hitpoints or less at the start of your turn, you need to make death saving throw: a Constitution saving throw with DC = 10 + your negative hp. On a success, you heal for 1d4. On a failure, you take 1d4 damage.

You don’t regain consciousness from healing in this way. If your hitpoints drops below your max hp in the negative, you die. If you roll a crit, you automatically succeed, and you heal for 3d4 instead. If you roll a fumble, you take 2d4 damage instead.

If someone stabilizes you with a successful Medical roll, you are brought up to 1 hp instantly.

# Melee Finisher

As a reaction to landing a successful melee attack, you may deal an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the target. Until the end of your next turn, enemies have Advantage x2 to hit you with an attack.

# Opportunity Attack

This is no longer a general rule. Instead, it is a feature with new text:

*As a reaction to a creature entering or exiting your melee range, you may make a melee attack against them.*

Not all creatures will have this feature.
