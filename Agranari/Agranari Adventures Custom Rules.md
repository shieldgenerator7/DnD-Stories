# Agranari Adventures Custom Rules

These are the custom rules for this campaign.

# Character Creation

## Ability Scores

Roll 1d20 at advantage x1 for each ability score individually. Then, you may reroll 1 ability score. Then, you may swap two ability scores.

## Character Options

The options available to you are slightly different than normal DnD. Here are the options to choose from. Notice that Class isn’t one of them.

### Species

This is essentially your Race, in DnD terms. You can choose from one of the following:

-   Cat
-   Wolf
-   Deer
-   Peacock
-   Beaver
-   Bear
-   Spider

Your species gives you ability score bonuses, background, languages, and0 extra features. It also determines your hit die.

Each species has its own unique set of backgrounds to choose from, each with their own stat bonuses.

Each species has its own unique stats to roll for, all of which will be recorded privately in the DM’s spreadsheet. These stats effect the effectiveness of the species’ features.

### Background

This is essentially a replacement for Class, but it’s more similar to Background in DnD terms. You choose your background from the list of backgrounds available for your Species. Your background gives you stat bonuses and some extra features.

# Advantage / Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage are reworked to be more flexible. Advantage and Disadvantage will often have a multiplier after it that says how many extra dice to roll, and how many dice to take away. If there is no multiplier specified, it is assumed that the multiplier is 1.

When rolling Advantage x1, roll 1 additional die, and remove the lowest die. Advantage x2: 2 additional dice, remove the lowest 2 dice.

When rolling Disdvantage x1, roll 1 additional die, and remove the highest die. Disdvantage x2: 2 additional dice, remove the highest 2 dice.

This way, Advantage and Disadvantage can be combined in more ways than just canceling each other out, and can be stacked on top of each other.

# Soft AC

You have a Soft AC equal to your AC + Soft AC Bonus. When you take damage from an attack that has to meet your AC to hit, determine whether or not it meets your Soft AC. If it doesn't meet your Soft AC, then you reduce the damage by your Soft AC Damage Reduction.

Example:  
You have an AC of 13, a Soft AC Bonus of 5, and a Soft AC Damage Reduction of 3. Therefore your Soft AC is (13 + 5) = 18. An enemy attacks you with a 15 to hit. It beats your AC, so the attack hits. However, it doesn't meet your Soft AC, so you apply damage reduction. The rolled attack damage is 7, so the damage you take is (7 - 3) = 4.
