# Chapter 1 – Zajar Zernam, Bear Veterinarian

It was a nice and sunny day as Zajar Zernam walked along the path to the ranch. The sun shone brilliantly through the treetops, the birds chirped, and his nose wasn’t bleeding. He wiggled his little black bear tail as he walked on two legs along the trail. His pouch, containing his medicine and tools, bounced along with each step. Soon the ranch house came into view, peeking between the trees.

The house was a moderate size, one story, with a sizable porch. On said porch, an old grizzly bear rocked back and forth in a rocking chair, cowboy hat tipped forward over his head.

“Hey there.” Zajar greeted.

The grizzly bear didn’t respond.

Zajar walked up to him and stood in front of him.

The grizzly bear didn’t respond. Instead, he breathed quietly, silently snoring. His nose had a little knob attached to it with a cleanly sliced end, as if it had been cut.

Zajar’s nose dripped. He wiped the blood off his nose and looked around. There was a pigsty with lots of pigs. At least one of which was seriously injured, or worse. Zajar shrugged as he stepped off the porch. The last step creaked under his weight.

“Who goes there!” The grizzly bear shot out of his chair and stood over Zajar.

“It’s me sir.”

“You? Who are you?”

“Zajar Zernam, I heard you have a patient here?”

“Ah, you’re the black bear who specializes in pigs.”

“That’s me. Do you have a pig that needs help?”

“Several. Follow me.” The grizzly bear led Zajar to the pigsty. “I’m Grarthta Oathswan, by the way.”

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Oathswan.”

“Ah, just call me Gra.” Gra took him to the pigpen, where a pig was laying on the ground motionless.

Zajar knelt on the ground next to the pig. The injury was immediately obvious: its hind leg had been slashed and was hanging on by a thin sheet of muscle. As he got close, Zajar’s nose bled profusely. He wiped it away, but it dripped so much he had to let it drip all over the ground. He grabbed the leg and the pig’s flesh and pushed them together. Holding it with one hand, he freed his healing hand. He raised his left hand, revealing a burn mark in the middle of his palm. The mark glowed a bright yellow, and he slapped it down on the pig’s wound. Like magic, the flesh around the leg sealed and glued itself back together. As it healed under his hand, he used his other hand to adjust the bone position to make sure it went back together correctly.

“You fixed Corn, thank you kindly.” Gra said.

Zajar wiped blood from his nose. “Not a problem.” His nose tingled, but it stopped bleeding out. “He’ll still need some time to recover, but he should live.”

“Thank you so much. Now if only I could get my other three pigs back, that’d be swell.”

“Well unfortunately, I can’t bring them back from the dead.”

“Oh, they’re not dead, *yet*. They got kidnapped by some monster a few days ago.” He pointed to a spot in the pig fence where debris and woodchips littered the ground. “I just put repaired that fence, haven’t had time to paint it yet.”

“What’s stopping you from finding them?”

Gra looked at the ground real quick, then back at Zajar. “No time. Well, gotta feed the pigs.”

Zajar followed Gra into the silo where he kept the food. On the way there, Zajar felt a drop of blood. He looked at the chicken pen. “Is one of your chickens in pain?”

“You’re probably sensing Henrietta. She’s getting old.”

“Mind if I take a look?”

“Go right ahead.”

Zajar let himself into the chicken pen and followed his dripping nose to the chicken coop. All the chickens scrambled out of his way but otherwise ignored the large black bear invading their coop.

“Cluck!” The chicken in question greeted Zajar.

“Hey there, Henrietta.” Zajar picked her up and petted her head. She calmed down, cooing quietly. He moved his nose around her, taking note of how much his nose bled while doing so. “Ah, it’s your stomach, isn’t it?” He set her down back in her nest. “I’ve got just the thing for you.” He took out his medicinal kit and started crushing herbs together.

Henrietta winced with each motion, not enjoying the noise at all. “Cluck!” She jumped out of her nest, wings flapping, and ran out of the coop.

Zajar tried blocking her with his legs, but he wasn’t fast enough.

The noise drew the attention of Gra. “What are you doing to my chickens?”

“Nothing sir.” Zajar came out, making a potion. “She just doesn’t like the noise.”

“Her ears are sensitive in her old age.”

“Can you help me catch her?”

“You bet your nose growth I can.” Gra picked up Henrietta and steadied her as Zajar poured the potion down her throat.

She clucked angrily.

“I know, Henrietta, but it’s for your own good.” Gra turned to Zajar. “Will this help her go painlessly?”

“No, it’s just an upset stomach. This potion will cure her of it in a little bit. After a day she should be good as new.”

“Well I’ll be damned. I could use a potion like that for myself.” Gra chuckled.

Zajar laughed too. “Did you see which way the pigs went?”

“Ah, you don’t have to bother. They’re probably already dead.”

“Which way?”

Gra sighed as set down Henrietta. “He went that way. The fella has been stealing my pigs for a long time now, stopping by once or twice a month.”

“Don’t worry, Gra. I’ll get your pigs back for you.”

“Thank you, lad.”

Zajar trotted through the woods in the given direction. He searched for any sign of the pigs, and finally found a pain signal. His nose dripped. He was on the trail. He found a blood trail on the ground. It was covered in leaves and dirt, and was very faint. It had been here a while. Following the trail took Zajar to a cave. It was dark and damp, but Zajar could see reasonably well in the dark.

He walked through the winding corridors, following the blood trail. It led to a cavernous chamber, which was empty, save for a giant skeleton in the corner. Upon closer inspection, the skeleton was that of a…

Zajar gasped.

It was a bear skeleton. A living, breathing, person had been killed and dragged out here, and left to rot. Few animals could do something like this, except for…

The Bloodlusted.

Zajar had always heard of the dangers of becoming bloodlusted, but he didn’t think that it was something that could happen anymore. Some bears have a tooth-shaped growth on their nose that allows them to sense pain. When a bear senses pain, their nose bleeds, and they get a strong urge to put the creature out of its pain, usually by consuming it. Zajar was always good at controlling this urge, and he thought every bear could control it just as easily. But there were always the rumors that giving into the urge to kill would eventually cause a bear to go mad. And become a mindless, thoughtless beast.

Zajar shook his head. “No, that can’t happen. I’m sure whoever killed this bear had a good reason to.”

As he steadied his shaking hand, he heard a rumble echoing through the cave. It came from close by, and it was accompanied by pig snorts and squeals. Zajar followed them to a wall, where the sounds seemed to be the closest. He looked for a hidden opening, but didn’t find any.

“Here it goes.” He balled up his fist and punched the wall. The rock cracked and pebbles fell from the ceiling.

The noises immediately stopped.

Zajar stood still, waiting for some sound before proceeding. After a few moments, the sound began again.

Zajar decided to explore the rest of the cave to see if there was another way out. He found some bones of a small mammal, but didn’t find a bear or pigs. “It’s probably a mountain lion or something.”

He determined there was no other way to the pigs, so went back to the blood trail to find a way in to the secret room.

Some footsteps splashed in puddles in that direction. A low growl echoed from the tunnel.

“Hello?” Zajar took a step forward.

Out of the shadows, a bear half a foot taller than him, and two feet wider than him, stepped closer to Zajar, red beady eyes staring daggers into him.

“Did you happen to find any pigs in here?”

The bear growled. It let out a mighty roar as it lifted its paw hand to strike.

“You’re between me and the pigs. If I have to get through you to rescue you them, I will!” Zajar lunged at the bear. He grabbed its neck in his jaws, biting down hard and drawing blood. He swiped at the wound he just opened with his claws, causing the bear to bleed out. Zajar’s nose flooded with blood from all the pain he felt coming from the bear. The mix of adrenaline and blood caused Zajar’s eyes to go blurry for a second. Just for a moment, he felt the urge to finish it off, but he held back.

The bear retaliated. It tried to bite Zajar in return, but its neck hurt too bad to move. Instead, it swiped at Zajar, opening up his chest. It stood tall over Zajar, screaming at the top of its lungs.

Zajar was undeterred. He raised his left hand, his burn mark glowing yellow, and sealed the wound on his chest.

No longer sensing any pain from its opponent, the frenzied and wounded bear pushed Zajar and backed off, running through the cave.

“Oh no you don’t!” Zajar ran after the bear. “I’m not going to let you go and lick your wounds!” Zajar turned a corner and—

ROAAAARRR! The bear lept out from behind the corner and attacked Zajar. It bit into his left shoulder and then ran away.

Zajar lept onto the bear and bit it in the back of the neck. He crunched down on the spine.

The bear fell limply to the ground.

Zajar wiped his nose, but the blood flowed so fast it was fruitless. The bear was still alive, and it was in tremendous pain. He sighed. “You don’t deserve this.” He pressed his glowing hand into the bear’s neck, sealing up the bite wound.

The bear’s breathing steadied, and its pain decreased.

Zajar stroked his head. “Hey there, it’ll be alright.” He stepped over the bear and listened for the pigs. The squeals led him to the wall he had previously punched. He punched the wall again, but again, nothing happened. “Maybe the bear knows?” He slapped the bear. “You awake?”

The bear jolted up, raised a paw to strike, and fell over backwards. It grunted.

“Where are the pigs at?”

The bear snorted.

“WHERE are the pigs AT?” Zajar roared.

The bear grunted. It didn’t say a single word.

Zajar looked to the side. Maybe this bear really *had* gone feral, and it no longer could understand him. Or, maybe it was its neck injury. That could cause it to not to be able to speak, right? “Can you point me in the direction of the pigs?”

The bear flopped a paw forward. It pointed in the direction of the pig squeals.

Zajar tried again in that direction, but found nothing. He asked the bear again, “Show me.”

The bear was already crawling along the ground, sliding its stomach across the wet rocks. It paid no attention to Zajar as it approached the wall Zajar had punched. It pulled itself up onto two legs with the wall, and then placed a foot on a rock jutting out from the wall. It slipped and fell onto its back.

“Ah, of course!” Zajar climbed up around the bear and found an opening high above head level just below the ceiling. “Secret tunnel!”

Up inside the secret area, was a pig trapped in a pit.

Zajar pulled it out and examined it. It felt no pain, and his nose didn’t bleed. “You’re fine, little pig. Albeit a lot heavier than I expected.”

“Oink!”

Zajar sniffed around. Blood filled the room. Including that of his own nose. He followed the pain to a second pig, bleeding out on the floor from a huge gash in its side. It was like something had taken a bite out of it.

“Hey there, little friend.” Zajar laid his glowing hand on the pig’s side, sealing the wound closed.

The pig tried to get up, but Zajar picked it up instead. It was heavier than he expected.

“Hold on there, little friend. You’re no longer bleeding, but you need to heal a bit more before you start walking again.”

Zajar’s nose led him to the third pig with smell instead of pain, for once. The third pig was laying in a pile of bones, having contributed to said pile a considerable amount. The guts were all over the place, and the vacant stare of its eyes confirmed to Zajar what his bloodlust already knew.

At least he was able to save two.

He sniffed the air. There was a fresh breeze blowing through, which could only mean one thing: a secret exit. He followed the scent and found an opening with a 10-foot drop to the ground below. He climbed down, and once safely on the ground, beckoned the two pigs to follow.

The first one jumped gleefully down into his arms. “Oink! Oink!’

“Ok, your turn!” Zajar held his arms wide.

The injured pig rolled off the ledge and landed in his arms. He almost lost his balance, but he leaned against the wall to hold it. He caught the pig safe and sound.

He carried the two pigs all the way back to the farm. He placed them back in the pig pen and closed the gate. He looked around for the rancher, who was sleeping in his rocking chair again.

“Hey there.”

“Huh?” Gra snorted awake.

“I’m back.”

“Oh. Did you find the pigs?”

“I found two. The third one was already eaten. One of the pigs was injured, so I healed it.”

“Thank you kindly. Where are they now?”

Zajar showed them to him in the pigpen. The healthy pig snorted around the pen, rolling in the mud. The injured pig lay on its side next to the feeding trough.

“Grain! Oats! It’s so good to see you again.” Gra exclaimed. He leaned down next to the injured pig. Stroking its head, he whispered softly to it, “It’s ok, Oats, this will pass soon.” He pressed his nose into the pig’s skin for a moment. When he came back up, his nose had a drop of blood on it.

“It’ll take a while, but Oats will make a full recovery.” Zajar reassured.

“Say, Zajar.” Gra stood up. “Do you like bacon?”

“I sure do! Do you got some?”

Gra sighed, picking up Oats the pig. “Come along.” He carried the pig to a large structure that looked like a barn from the outside, but on the inside, it was anything but. “I’m going to need your help with this.”

“What can I do?”

“Hold Oats down on the counter here, keep your hands away from its neck.”

“Can do.”

Gra grabbed a battleaxe and held it above the counter. “Hold him still now.” He brought the axe down to the pig’s neck, just barely touching. He swung it up and let it drop.

Zajar’s nose let out a drop of blood in the split second that the axe made contact with the pig’s neck. The next moment, his nose stopped bleeding. Zajar instinctively reached out to catch the pig’s head from rolling off the counter.

“Rest in pig heaven, Oats.” Gra caressed the head of the pig and kissed it on the forehead. “You lived to serve a purpose and I hope I gave you a good life.” Then he turned to Zajar. “So, what part of the pig do you like the most?”

Zajar took in the smell of pig blood, the delicious, delicious smell. “The haunches.”

“I can do that.” The rancher took out a knife and skinned the pig, then did some fine-cutting. He carried the pig to the cellar and hung it on a hook. “It’s gotta cure for a little bit. For now, we can eat Spices or Grits.”

“I don’t like grits.”

“Spices it is then. She was a sweet girl.” He took a pig carcass off a hook and laid it on a counter. He took his knife and carved a few slices off the side. “I’m sure the wolves won’t mind a few missing slices.” He took the slices to his ranch house, where he put them on a pan and lit a fire in the living room fireplace.

“That’s smelling good.” Zajar salivated to the point of drooling.

“So, about the pigs. Did you see who kidnapped them?”

“It was a grizzly bear. I thought it was a black bear at first, but it was just covered in dried blood.”

“Oh.” Gra stared stoically into the fire. “Did it have two beaty red eyes.”

Zajar nodded. “Scariest thing I’ve ever seen.”

He nodded. “How’s he doing?”

“I tore him a new one, but he’s still breathing, last I checked. He’ll probably end up being the second skeleton in that cave, unless he gets medical attention.”

“So it’s true.” Gra nodded.

“What?”

“The bacon is sizzling. Do you like it a little more raw or crispy?”

“Crispy please.”

“Very well.”

“Do you know that bear?”

Gra looked Zajar straight in the eye, and said… nothing. He went back to poking the bacon. “What can I do to repay your kindness? Besides the bacon, of course.”

“I could use some money for some new tools.”

“Ah, coin, that’s right. Uh…” Gra looked around the room. “I’ve probably got a few coins laying around in here somewhere. You can go searching for them if you want, I don’t have any use for them. The bacon’s gonna be awhile anyways.”

“Ok.” Zajar searched the ranch house. He explored into the master bedroom. It had a big bed enough for two, with sheets neatly placed. He looked under the bed: a copper coin! He plopped it into his shoulder bag. In the corner were a stack of folded sheets. He searched through them, but found nothing. He did his best to put them back in an orderly fashion. He came back to the living room. “Found a copper so far.”

“Lucky day!”

Zajar found a hallway with two shut doors. He opened the first door, and found a room covered in claw marks. A layer of dust coated everything: the walls, the floor, and the worn out bed. He blew some dust around, scoring a gold coin from under the bed.

Then he checked the second shut door. This one was locked.

“Hey, this door won’t open.”

“Oh, that’s Onortia’s room. She hid the key in here somewhere. If you find it, make sure to put it back in a different hiding place.”

“But how would she know where to find it then?”

Gra was silent.

Zajar shrugged. “Huh. Ok.”

He searched the kitchen. He found lots of cutlery and utensils, but no key. Then, in the cupboard, behind a pile of old knives, was a tiny wooden box. Inside was a metal key. “Found it.”

Gra poked at the bacon, fist clenched.

Zajar put the key in the lock, twisted it, and turned the door handle. The door bent in half as he pushed it open. Huge slashes on the outside of the door made it unstable. It was only now that Zajar realized the door wasn’t ever actually meaningfully locked, with how the door could just be caved in. But that wasn’t the biggest shock.

Like the other room, this one was covered in dust and cobwebs. But the bed in this room was in shambles. Splinters of it were spread across the floor, and it was straight up broken in two. Beneath the dust were traces of dried blood. The bed sheet, frame, and headboard were all stained in blood. It was bear’s blood.

Zajar gasped. He peeked outside the door to check on Gra, who was still silently poking the bacon.

Turning his attention back to the room, Zajar looked under the bed. There, hidden under a pile of dust, cobwebs, and bloodstained sheets, was a single silver coin. It cuddled up in his hand as he brought it into the daylight. A blue shimmer flashed across its face as Zajar examined it. He gently placed it in his shoulder bag.

Search complete, he reassembled the door to the best of his ability and relocked it. Key back in box, he went to the kitchen to hide it.

“Hey, let me see where you found it.”

Zajar showed him the hiding place behind the knives where he found it.

“Clever, I would have never thought to look there.” He looked for the box. “Where is it now?”

“I hid it.”

“Can you tell me—” Gra took a deep breath and turned away. “Never mind. Don’t tell me.”

“Mr. Oathswan?”

He sat next to the campfire. “Bacon’s done.”

Zajar sat next to him.

“Want the first slice of Spices?”

“Sure.” Zajar crunched on the greasy bacon slice. “Hmm, crispy!”

“Find anything good?”

“A copper coin, a gold coin, and a silver.” Zajar presented them to him.

“Good find! I hope you can get yourself some good tools with that.”

“What about you? I’ve seen your tools. They’re pretty old.”

“Nah, those old things? I could sharpen them forever.”

“They’re getting pretty worn down.” Zajar plopped the copper and the gold into his hands. “Here, take these.”

“But—”

“My tools are fairly new anyways. Besides, the bacon is *plenty*.”

“But you’re taking the silver one?”

“Yes. There’s something… special about it.”

Gra took a deep breath. “She likes you. I’m glad. Can I see her for a second?”

Zajar set the silver coin in his hands.

He took the silver coin in his palm, and caressed it. He gave it a kiss and another hug. “You be good for Zajar here, you hear? He’ll take good care of you.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. Is that coin special to you?”

“No—I mean yes, but I want you to have it.” Gra took Zajar’s hand and opened it. He placed the silver coin in his palm, and slowly closed it, wrapping his hand around the coin.

Zajar sensed something… an energy, a presence, a spirit? He examined the coin. It was standard issue from the Cat Kingdom, minted several decades ago. For how old it was, it showed surprisingly little wear and tear. The neutral expression of the Cat Queen was just as detailed as the day it was made. It had a youthful energy to it. He held it up to the light, and a blue shimmer washed over it. He couldn’t tell how, but he knew this coin was special, and that he wanted it, and that *it* wanted him to want it, too.

“You know what she wanted to be when she grew up?” Gra took another deep breath and looked at a portrait on the wall. It showed four bears cuddling up for a big bear hug. “She wanted to be a veterinarian.”

Zajar nodded. He laid a hand on Gra’s shoulder. “I’ll take good care of her.”

Gra reached for a slice of bacon, but his hand stopped before it could reach his mouth.

“So, those rooms. They’re pretty empty.”

“Believe you me, they weren’t always empty.”

“I get that. But maybe it’s time to clean them up a bit. You’ve got a pretty nice place here. Maybe you could start a bed and breakfast?”

The rancher snorted a whiff of bacon. “You know, that’s not a bad idea. But where would I even start?”

“I’m not sure, but I can help you figure it out.”

“Thanks, but I don’t want to tie up anymore of your time.”

“No problem, I usually just wait around until I need to make another house call. Might as well stay somewhere I can be useful, you know?”

Gra chuckled. “Alright, Zajar, you got yourself a deal.”

Zajar smiled, looking into the face of the silver coin, which smiled back.

# Chapter 2 – Zemorsin, Deer Slave

A young fawn ran through the woods, heart racing. He dared not look back. Any moment now, the wolves could be on his trail. It could be his wolf father, his wolf mother, or even his wolf brother. But more than likely, it would be the scary wolf with the glowing eye in his forehead.

He traveled for days. Through forests, swamps, and mountains he traveled. This was the longest he had ever gone without the scary wolf finding him. He passed several towns, but didn’t trust them enough to go in. He was hungry, thirsty, and exhausted. He chewed on a stone hoof clipping an adult deer had given him. According to the deer, the letters on the side spelled out his name, Zemorsin.

Finally, after a week or so of traveling, he found the delicious smell of food out in the middle of nowhere. His mouth salivated just from the smell of strawberries and blueberries.

He walked in the woods alongside a road, keeping alert to hide in case anyone came by.

And someone did. A doe walked along the road, towing a two-wheeled cart behind her. In the cart was a bunch of hay, jiggling in time with her steps and the tune she hummed. Her ear twitched and she looked in his direction.

Zemorsin ducked and stayed still.

After a brief moment, the doe continued forward, humming her cheerful tune again.

Zemorsin breathed a sigh of relief, and followed her along the trail, keeping in the thick brush. His hooves were light and soft, and had been for several days since he modified them to be quieter. As he walked, he barely made any noise.

The doe pulled the wagon into a clearing in the trees where a dirt courtyard laid before a tall wooden silo. She stuck her muzzle in the air and called out, *BLEE-***EEEAA***-AT!*

Heavy footsteps approached from behind the silo. After a minute, a bear appeared from within the silo! It wore a vest and a straw hat.

Zemorsin gulped.

From behind the silo, the scary wolf stepped out. He pointed at the bear, raised his hands, claws bared. He made chomping motions, and waved his muzzle around, miming tearing flesh apart. Then he licked his lips, pointing at the bear. Then he went back behind the silo.

Zemorsin sat behind a bush and changed his fur color to blend in with the shrubs, watching and listening intently. Maybe the bear will go away so he can get into the silo.

“Good morning, Karti,” The bear greeted the deer.

“Why hello, Gra Bear.” Karti let go of the cart handles.

“How was your trip?”

“It was pretty relaxing. It’s a nice day for a walk.”

“Hopefully your walk was a little smoother this time.” Gra reached into the wagon and picked up the entire pile of hay in his arms.

“It was! I noticed you fixed those potholes. Thank you.” Karti did some stretches.

“Not a problem. I couldn’t have those troubling you again.”

“Well I’ll let you know if they return.” Karti laughed. She straightened her legs and bent down, reaching for her hooves, tail up.

Gra disappeared into the silo for a minute, then came back out. “Thanks for the delivery, Karti.” He handed Karti a good-sized leather bag.

“You know I’d do anything for your pork rinds!” She reached into the bag and popped one into her mouth. “Thanks a bunch!”

“Any time. Would you like to stay for a cup of tea?”

“Thanks for the offer, but I have a bunch more deliveries to make. Maybe next time!” She picked up the cart handles and walked away.

“See you next time!” Gra waved.

“Next time!” Karti called back. She walked past Zemorsin’s bush.

Zemorsin held his breath.

The doe’s ear flicked in his direction, but she was too busy popping pork rinds to pay attention to him. She pulled the cart down the winding forest path until she was out of view.

Zemorsin turned back to the bear. He was gone! Zemorsin looked around frantically, trying to find him. Then he heard a thumping sound from within the silo, as if someone was stacking things and moving things around.

A low growl came from within the silo. “Ah, that’s a good supply delivery.” The bear continued to do stuff from within the silo.

Zemorsin climbed a tree to get a better vantage point. This ranch had a pig pen with a pig shelter, a chicken enclosure with two chicken coops, and another big building behind the silo. He heard the bear leave the silo and enter through a door farther away.

Zemorsin took this opportunity to raid the silo. He climbed down the tree and ran into the silo. The smells of several different foods greeted him at the entrance: oats, barley, hay, chicken feed, and the sweet, sweet smell of strawberries and blueberries.

He followed his nose into the dark chamber that held the berries. The small slit windows at the top barely let any illumination into the room, but it was enough.

The room was lined on all four walls with crates and crates of goodies. Zemorsin peeked into one of the crates on the top. It had strawberries! But when he picked one up, it was stuck to the other ones, and had an all too familiar texture: stone.

He jumped back. Stone? He peeked in. The berries were all stone, and stuck together. He sniffed the air. There were definitely berries here, somewhere.

He looked at the entrance. His wolf father entered the room. “Zemorsin! Move those rocks!”

He nodded, and picked up the crate, setting it on the floor. The berry smell got stronger.

“Again!”

Zemorsin picked up the next crate, and set it on the floor. The crate underneath had actually berries! “I did it, father!” Zemorsin looked at the entrance, but his wolf father had disappeared.

His wolf mother walked in. “Zemorsin! Eat those berries!” Then she disappeared too.

He nodded. He reached a grabby hoof in and pulled out a handful of berries. He stuffed them in his mouth, greens and all. He ate handful after handful, gobbling the delicious berries down. He spent a good long time filling his empty belly.

Then a door creaked, and heavy footsteps thumped out to the yard.

Zemorsin peaked around the corner of the room entrance, looking into the middle of the ranch.

The bear was walking to the pig pen. He opened the gate and went inside. Several dozen pigs surrounded him.

“Grain! Corn! Barley!” The bear greeted each pig as they came to him. “Are you ready for your lunch? Are *you* ready for your lunch?"

*OINK OINK!* The pigs all oinked in excitement.

“Ok, I’ll go get you your lunch.”

The bear turned and looked in the young fawn’s direction.

Zemorsin ducked and slinked further into the silo, out of view.

“Hello?” The bear called out. “Is someone there?”

The hairs on the back of Zemorsin’s fluffy neck stood on end. He ran out of the silo and hid in some weeds up against the silo wall. He changed his fur color to blend in with the weeds.

The footsteps approached. “Hello?” The bear counted quietly in the distance, then continued coming closer. “Henrietta, that better not be you getting into the chicken feed again!”

The bear searched the silo, lingering a little longer in the berry room. “Did I leave these berries unstacked again?” After some moving around, the bear came outside.

Zemorsin held his breath.

The bear looked at him, but didn’t seem to register his presence. After a moment, he stepped closer. He stared in his general direction.

Zemorsin froze, steadying his muscles to not make any movements.

The bear shrugged. “Huh, must’ve been a wild animal.” He looked around. “Who’s hungry?” The bear went back into the silo and picked up some food to take to the pigs and chickens.

Zemorsin was frozen in fear. He let himself relax enough to breathe and sit comfortably, but that was it.

The scary wolf peaked out from behind a tree.

Zemorsin jumped as he sat.

“Bears will eat you whole!” The scary wolf laughed as it disappeared behind the tree.

Zemorsin waited several hours, listening as the bear fed the animals, did his chores, and rocked in his chair. It became afternoon, which led into dusk, and then into night. Finally when the half moon was high in the sky, the bear opened his creaky door, creaked across the floor boards to a corner of the ranch house, creaked on something else, and started creaking himself. The bear snored loudly. No wonder this guy had no neighbors within 5 miles.

Zemorsin pricked his ears. Other than the bear, he couldn’t hear anyone else in the area. No strange scents were nearby, and he didn’t see anyone around. Still, his fear held him in place.

Finally, the cold night air convinced him to move. The dusk breeze chilled him to shivers. He had been used to sleeping in cold areas, but he never realized how more comfortable it was to be in a wind-free area.

He stood up, surveying his surroundings again. No one was there. He tiptoed into the silo, trying to get comfy among the crates. He looked down into a crate, and saw a bunch of rocks.

His wolf father jumped out from behind a crate. “Zemorsin! No sleeping on the job!”

Zemorsin jumped back, clutching his hoof clippings. He left the silo behind, in search of another hiding place. He followed the wind into the ranch. He snuck past the house.

The bear inside continued to snore loudly, until he didn’t. The bear snorted and was suddenly silent.

Zemorsin froze. He was out in the open.

The bear snored again, and continued to snore.

Zemorsin hastened his step, still taking care to not make any noise. He walked around the house, and found a porch. It had no railings, but it was only as tall as Zemorsin was, which wasn’t very tall. He could see through the spaces between the steps, where there was a bunch of empty space. Plus lots of weeds!

The front of the porch was covered with a wooden lattice pattern. Zemorsin tried to fit his head in, but he was too big. Not a problem!

Zemorsin focused his power through his middle hoof, placing it on his chest. As his hoof grew, his body shrank. His legs shortened and his height decreased. The already big world got even bigger to him. After shrinking down to a third of his size, he finally stopped shrinking. He was roughly the size of a house cat. He snapped his hoof off, and put the clipping with the other ones, which were about the size of his head now.

He crawled through the gaps in the lattice and cozied himself up among the weeds. It was still cold, but there was less wind here, and more weeds, which made the place comfier. Plus, there was now a roof! A roof through which he could still see the half moon, sure, but a roof nonetheless.

Zemorsin closed his eyes, and went to sleep.

=======

The snoring stopped.

Zemorsin woke up. It was the crack of dawn, and the creak of doors.

The bear was inside the ranch house, creaking his way to the porch. The door creaked open, and the old bear waddled out to the porch. Dust fell from the floor boards above Zemorsin as the bear walked to his rocking chair.

*Kreeeee… Innng… Kreeeee… Innng…*

Zemorsin kept his head down, waiting for the bear to leave.

“Welp, better get ready for the wolf delivery!” The bear stepped down the stairs.

Three wolves popped out from behind the barn, and one little wolf growled. They all looked straight at him through the lattice.

Zemorsin closed his eyes and shook his head. When he opened his eyes, they were gone.

The bear grabbed the sliding door handle and slid the front door of the barn wide open. Inside the barn, there was a whole wall of horrors: bloody tools, bloody weapons of war, and big patches of blood covering counters and floors.

Zemorsin turned away. He waited under the porch, listening as the bear went deep into the barn and made a lot of noise.

An hour or so later, a cart was coming up the driveway. It was being pulled by a peacock!

The scary wolf’s head dropped down from the porch. “Peacocks! There was one near our wolf village once. A deer went into the forest to investigate it. He never returned. A search party was sent in to find him. They never returned either. I was sent in to find them, all alone. I didn’t find them, but I did find statues of them. Real-life, full-size, *statues*.” The scary wolf chuckled as he pulled his head back up onto the porch, and out view. His mocking laughter abruptly ended.

Zemorsin’s heart raced as he examined his fur pattern to make sure he was blending in. He watched in anticipation as the peacock got closer and closer.

Just when the peacock looked his way, it turned towards the barn, paying him no mind.

Zemorsin sighed in relief.

The peacock turned so Zemorsin could see the back of his two-wheeled wagon. It had a lot of stone in the back.

Wolf father crawled under the wagon. “Zemorsin! Help with the delivery!”

Zemorsin jumped back against the wall, holding his hoof clippings tight.

The peacock walked in front of the wagon, and when he passed by, wolf father was gone.

The peacock knocked on a side door to the barn. “Gra, you in there?”

Gra opened the door. “Good morning, Pooroo. How are you?”

“Just fine, Gra. How’s your little project going?”

“Oh, my B&B? Not too bad, still gotta get the rooms set up. Got them cleaned up though, at least.”

“That’s good to hear. You got the goods?”

“Yeah, come on in.” Gra led Pooroo into the barn. “I’ve got Salt and Vinegar ready for you.”

“Oh they’re good-sized too!” Pooroo delighted.

Zemorsin couldn’t see what they were doing, but he could hear the sound of gravel falling into a pit, if the pit was lined with flesh. It was definitely not a pleasant sound.

Gra grunted, and came out of the barn carrying two pig-sized boulders. He gently placed them into the cart, which was reinforced with steel. He then clapped his hands together, spraying dust everywhere. “That’s some good meats.”

“The wolves sure think so.” Pooroo grabbed the handles to his cart. “They said your pigs are by far their favorite.”

“Why that’s a mighty fine compliment. I’m glad they enjoy them so much.”

“You take pride in work, to the point of perfection.” Pooroo smiled. “You would’ve made a fine peacock.”

“And you’re extra compassionate. Would make for a decent bear.”

Pooroo chuckled. “In another life, maybe.”

“Say, you want to stick around for some tea? Those pigs ain’t going nowhere.”

“I’d love to, Gra, but I gotta make my quota. Pleasure doing business with you.”

“And with you.” Gra nodded.

The peacock pulled the cart back down the driveway and away. The small boulders in his cart barely moved as he walked. The wheels left trails in the dry dirt and gravel.

“What?” The bear said with surprise in his voice.

Zemorsin looked at the bear, who seemed to have been looking at him until just a moment ago. His ears folded back. He shrank back into the weeds, and sat still.

“What… a lovely day it is today!” The bear looked at the rocking chair on the porch. He stepped forward. “What a nice day to sit on the porch and rock.” He took more steps forward.

Zemorsin froze as the bear got closer.

The bear patted around his vest. “Where is it?” He dipped his paws into the pockets, pulling out chicken feed and other random oddities. “Aha!” He pulled out a carrot and gave it a good, long sniff. “Look at this carrot! Look at this delicious, delectable carrot!” He took a few steps closer, until he was right in front of the porch. “I’m going to eat this carro—whoops!” The carrot fell on the ground in front of Zemorsin.

His stomach rumbled. He was hungry, and the carrot looked appetizing.

“Oh no!” The bear cried. “I dropped my carrot. Oh well, I guess it’ll just stay there until someone picks it up. Anyway, I’ve got chores to do.” He walked around to the side of the house, where the footstep sounds stopped. But then a *plink* hit the far side of the house.

Zemorsin flitted his ears about. Then he looked around. There was no sign of the bear, though he had a feeling he was still close.

But he was too hungry. He reached out and grabbed the carrot, and munched on it happily. Zemorsin glanced over to where he last saw the bear, and saw his big muzzle peaking out from the side of the house. His eyes were staring straight at him, even through the stairs!

Zemorsin jumped through the lattice, grabbing his hoof clippings and carrot on the way out. He ran past the bear to the woods.

“Hey, young fawn!” The bear called out. “It’s fine, I’m not going to hurt you.”

Zemorsin kept running.

“Do you want some tea?”

Zemorsin jumped behind a bush and changed his fur pattern to blend in. He peeked back at the bear, collecting yet another hoof clipping.

The bear was looking in his general direction, but was scanning the tree line. “Where’d he go?”

Zemorsin sighed in relief.

“Well, it’s good to see children here again.” The bear walked up the porch and rocked in his chair.

Zemorsin sat in the bush, watching him. He snacked on his carrot.
