# Chapter 1 – Zajar Zernam, Bear Veternarian

It was a nice and sunny day as Zajar Zernam walked along the path to the ranch. The sun shone brilliantly through the tree tops, the birds chirped, and his nose wasn’t bleeding. He wiggled his little black bear tail as he walked on two legs along the trail. His pouch, containing his medicine and tools, bounced along with each step. Soon the ranch house came into view, peeking between the trees.

The house was a moderate size, one story, with a sizable porch. On said porch, an old grizzly bear rocked back and forth in a rocking chair, cowboy hat tipped forward over his head.

“Hey there.” Zajar greeted.

The grizzly bear didn’t respond.

Zajar walked up to him and stood in front of him.

The grizzly bear didn’t respond.

Zajar’s nose dripped. He wiped the blood off his nose and looked around. There was a pigsty with lots of pigs. At least one of which was seriously injured, or worse. Zajar shrugged as he stepped off the porch. The last step creaked under his weight.

“Who goes there!” The grizzly bear shot out of his chair and stood over Zajar.

“It’s me sir.”

“You? Who are you?”

“Zajar Zernam, I heard you have a patient here?”

“Ah, you’re the black bear who specializes in pigs.”

“That’s me. Do you have a pig that needs help?”

“Several. Follow me.” The grizzly bear led Zajar to the pigsty. “I’m Grarthta Oathswan, by the way.”

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Oathswan.”

“Ah, just call me Gra.” Gra took him to the pigpen, where a pig was laying on the ground motionless.

Zajar knelt on the ground next to the pig. The injury was immediately obvious: its hind leg had been slashed and has hanging on by a thin sheet of muscle. As he got close, Zajar’s nose bled profusely. He wiped it away, but it dripped so much he had to let it drip all over the ground. He grabbed the leg and the pig’s flesh and pushed them together. Holding it with one hand, he freed his healing hand. He raised his left hand, revealing a burn mark in the middle of his palm. The mark glowed a bright yellow, and he slapped it down on the pig’s wound. Like magic, the flesh around the leg sealed and glued itself back together. As it healed under his hand, he used his other hand to adjust the bone position to make sure it went back together correctly.

“You fixed Corn, thank you kindly.” Gra said.

Zajar wiped blood from his nose. “Not a problem.” His nose tingled, but it stopped bleeding out. “He’ll still need some time to recover, but he should live.”

“Thank you so much. Now if only I could get my other three pigs back, that’d be swell.”

“Well unfortunately, I can’t bring them back from the dead.”

“Oh they’re not dead, *yet*. They got kidnapped by some monster a few days ago.” He pointed to a spot in the pig fence where debris and woodchips littered the ground. “I just put repaired that fence, haven’t had time to paint it yet.”

“What’s stopping you from finding them?”

Gra looked at the ground real quick, then back at Zajar. “No time. Well, gotta feed the pigs.”

Zajar followed Gra into the silo where he kept the food. On the way there, Zajar felt a drop of blood. He looked at the chicken pen. “Is one of your chickens in pain?”

“You’re probably sensing Henrietta. She’s getting old.”

“Mind if I take a look?”

“Go right ahead.”

Zajar let himself into the chicken pen and followed his dripping nose to the chicken coop. All the chickens scrambled out of his way but otherwise ignored the large black bear invading their coop.

“Cluck!” The chicken in question greeted Zajar.

“Hey there, Henrietta.” Zajar picked her up and petted her head. She calmed down, cooing quietly. He moved his nose around her, taking note of how much his nose bled while doing so. “Ah, it’s your stomach, isn’t it?” He set her down back in her nest. “I’ve got just the thing for you.” He took out his medicinal kit and started crushing herbs together.

Henrietta winced with each motion, not enjoying the noise at all. “Cluck!” She jumped out of her nest, wings flapping, and ran out of the coop.

Zajar tried blocking her with his legs, but he wasn’t fast enough.

The noise drew the attention of Gra. “What are you doing to my chickens?”

“Nothing sir.” Zajar came out, making a potion. “She just doesn’t like the noise.”

“Her ears are sensitive in her old age.”

“Can you help me catch her?”

“You bet your nose growth I can.” Gra picked up Henrietta and steadied her as Zajar poured the potion down her throat.

She clucked angrily.

“I know, Henrietta, but it’s for your own good.” Gra turned to Zajar. “Will this help her go painlessly?”

“No, it’s just an upset stomach. This potion will cure her of it in a little bit. After a day she should be good as new.”

“Well I’ll be damned. I could use a potion like that for myself.” Gra chuckled.

Zajar laughed too. “Did you see which way the pigs went?”

“Ah, you don’t have to bother. They’re probably already dead.”

“Which way?”

Gra sighed as set down Henrietta. “He went that way. The fella has been stealing my pigs for a long time now, stopping by once or twice a month.”

“Don’t worry, Gra. I’ll get your pigs back for you.”

“Thank you, lad.”

Zajar trotted through the woods in the given direction. He searched for any sign of the pigs, and finally found a pain signal. His nose dripped. He was on the trail. He found a blood trail on the ground. It was covered in leaves and dirt, and was very faint. It had been here a while. Following the trail took Zajar to a cave. It was dark and damp, but Zajar could see reasonably well in the dark.

He walked through the winding corridors, following the blood trail. It led to a cavernous chamber, which was empty, save for a giant skeleton in the corner. Upon closer inspection, the skeleton was that of a…

Zajar gasped.

It was a bear skeleton. A living, breathing, person had been killed and dragged out here, and left to rot. Few animals could do something like this, except for…

The Bloodlusted.

Zajar had always heard of the dangers of becoming bloodlusted, but he didn’t think that it was something that could happen anymore. Some bears have a tooth-shaped growth on their nose that allows them to sense pain. When a bear senses pain, their nose bleeds, and they get a strong urge to put the creature out of its pain, usually by consuming it. Zajar was always good at controlling this urge, and he thought every bear could control it just as easily. But there were always the rumors that giving into the urge to kill would eventually cause a bear to go mad. And become a mindless, thoughtless beast.

Zajar shook his head. “No, that can’t happen. I’m sure whoever killed this bear had a good reason to.”

As he steadied his shaking hand, he heard a rumble echoing through the cave. It came from close by, and it was accompanied by pig snorts and squeals. Zajar followed them to a wall, where the sounds seemed to be the closest. He looked for a hidden opening, but didn’t find any.

“Here it goes.” He balled up his fist and punched the wall. The rock cracked and pebbles fell from the ceiling.

The noises immediately stopped.

Zajar stood still, waiting for some sound before proceeding. After a few moments, the sound began again.

Zajar decided to explore the rest of the cave to see if there was another way out. He found some bones of a small mammal, but didn’t find a bear or pigs. “It’s probably a mountain lion or something.”

He determined there was no other way to the pigs, so went back to the blood trail to find a way in to the secret room.

Some footsteps splashed in puddles in that direction. A low growl echoed from the tunnel.

“Hello?” Zajar took a step forward.

Out of the shadows, a bear half a foot taller than him, and two feet wider than him, stepped closer to Zajar, red beady eyes staring daggers into him.

“Did you happen to find any pigs in here?”

The bear growled. It let out a mighty roar as it lifted its paw hand to strike.

“You’re between me and the pigs. If I have to get through you to rescue you them, I will!” Zajar lunged at the bear. He grabbed its neck in his jaws, biting down hard and drawing blood. He swiped at the wound he just opened with his claws, causing the bear to bleed out. Zajar’s nose flooded with blood from all the pain he felt coming from the bear. The mix of adrenaline and blood caused Zajar’s eyes to go blurry for a second. Just for a moment, he felt the urge to finish it off, but he held back.

The bear retaliated. It tried to bite Zajar in return, but its neck hurt too bad to move. Instead, it swiped at Zajar, opening up his chest. It stood tall over Zajar, screaming at the top of its lungs.

Zajar was undeterred. He raised his left hand, his burn mark glowing yellow, and sealed the wound on his chest.

No longer sensing any pain from its opponent, the frenzied and wounded bear pushed Zajar and backed off, running through the cave.

“Oh no you don’t!” Zajar ran after the bear. “I’m not going to let you go and lick your wounds!” Zajar turned a corner and—

ROAAAARRR! The bear lept out from behind the corner and attacked Zajar. It bit into his left shoulder and then ran away.

Zajar lept onto the bear and bit it in the back of the neck. He crunched down on the spine.

The bear fell limply to the ground.

Zajar wiped his nose, but the blood flowed so fast it was fruitless. The bear was still alive, and it was in tremendous pain. He sighed. “You don’t deserve this.” He pressed his glowing hand into the bear’s neck, sealing up the bite wound.

The bear’s breathing steadied, and its pain decreased.

Zajar stroked his head. “Hey there, it’ll be alright.” He stepped over the bear and listened for the pigs. The squeals led him to the wall he had previously punched. He punched the wall again, but again, nothing happened. “Maybe the bear knows?” He slapped the bear. “You awake?”

The bear jolted up, raised a paw to strike, and fell over backwards. It grunted.

“Where are the pigs at?”

The bear snorted.

“WHERE are the pigs AT?” Zajar roared.

The bear grunted. It didn’t say a single word.

Zajar looked to the side. Maybe this bear really *had* gone feral, and it no longer could understand him. Or, maybe it was its neck injury. That could cause it to not to be able to speak, right? “Can you point me in the direction of the pigs?”

The bear flopped a paw forward. It pointed in the direction of the pig squeals.

Zajar tried again in that direction, but found nothing. He asked the bear again, “Show me.”

The bear was already crawling along the ground, sliding its stomach across the wet rocks. It paid no attention to Zajar as it approached the wall Zajar had punched. It pulled itself up onto two legs with the wall, and then placed a foot on a rock jutting out from the wall. It slipped and fell onto its back.

“Ah, of course!” Zajar climbed up around the bear and found an opening high above head level just below the ceiling. “Secret tunnel!”

Up inside the secret area, was a pig trapped in a pit.

Zajar pulled it out and examined it. It felt no pain, and his nose didn’t bleed. “You’re fine, little pig. Albeit a lot heavier than I expected.”

“Oink!”

Zajar sniffed around. Blood filled the room. Including that of his own nose. He followed the pain to a second pig, bleeding out on the floor from a huge gash in its side. It was like something had taken a bite out of it.

“Hey there, little friend.” Zajar laid his glowing hand on the pig’s side, sealing the wound closed.

The pig tried to get up, but Zajar picked it up instead. It was heavier than he expected.

“Hold on there, little friend. You’re no longer bleeding, but you need to heal a bit more before you start walking again.”

Zajar’s nose led him to the third pig with smell instead of pain, for once. The third pig was laying in a pile of bones, having contributed to said pile a considerable amount. The guts were all over the place, and the vacant stare of its eyes confirmed to Zajar what his bloodlust already knew.

At least he was able to save two.

He sniffed the air. There was a fresh breeze blowing through, which could only mean one thing: a secret exit. He followed the scent and found an opening with a 10-foot drop to the ground below. He climbed down, and once safely on the ground, beckoned the two pigs to follow.

The first one jumped gleefully down into his arms. “Oink! Oink!’

“Ok, your turn!” Zajar held his arms wide.

The injured pig rolled off the ledge and landed in his arms. He almost lost his balance, but he leaned against the wall to hold it. He caught the pig safe and sound.

He carried the two pigs all the way back to the farm. He placed them back in the pig pen and closed the gate. He looked around for the rancher, who was sleeping in his rocking chair again.

“Hey there.”

“Huh?” Gra snorted awake.

“I’m back.”

“Oh. Did you find the pigs?”

“I found two. The third one was already eaten. One of the pigs was injured, so I healed it.”

“Thank you kindly. Where are they now?”

Zajar showed them to him in the pigpen. The healthy pig snorted around the pen, rolling in the mud. The injured pig lay on its side next to the feeding trough.

“Grain! Oats! It’s so good to see you again.” Gra exclaimed. He leaned down next to the injured pig. Stroking its head, he whispered softly to it, “It’s ok, Oats, this will pass soon.” He pressed his nose into the pig’s skin for a moment. When he came back up, his nose had a drop of blood on it.

“It’ll take a while, but Oats will make a full recovery.” Zajar reassured.

“Say, Zajar.” Gra stood up. “Do you like bacon?”

“I sure do! Do you got some?”

Gra sighed, picking up Oats the pig. “Come along.” He carried the pig to a large structure that looked like a barn from the outside, but on the inside, it was anything but. “I’m going to need your help with this.”

“What can I do?”

“Hold Oats down on the counter here, keep your hands away from its neck.”

“Can do.”

Gra grabbed a battleaxe and held it above the counter. “Hold him still now.” He brought the axe down to the pig’s neck, just barely touching. He swung it up and let it drop.

Zajar’s nose let out a drop of blood in the split second that the axe made contact with the pig’s neck. The next moment, his nose stopped bleeding. Zajar instinctively reached out to catch the pig’s head from rolling off the counter.

“Rest in pig heaven, Oats.” Gra caressed the head of the pig and kissed it on the forehead. “You lived to serve a purpose and I hope I gave you a good life.” Then he turned to Zajar. “So, what part of the pig do you like the most?”

Zajar took in the smell of pig blood, the delicious, delicious smell. “The haunches.”

“I can do that.” The rancher took out a knife and skinned the pig, then did some fine-cutting. He carried the pig to the cellar and hung it on a hook. “It’s gotta cure for a little bit. For now, we can eat Spices or Grits.”

“I don’t like grits.”

“Spices it is then. She was a sweet girl.” He took a pig carcass off a hook and laid it on a counter. He took his knife and carved a few slices off the side. “I’m sure the wolves won’t mind a few missing slices.” He took the slices to his ranch house, where he put them on a pan and lit a fire in the living room fireplace.

“That’s smelling good.” Zajar salvated to the point of drooling.

“So, about the pigs. Did you see who kidnapped them?”

“It was a grizzly bear. I thought it was a black bear at first, but it was just covered in dried blood.”

“Oh.” Gra stared stoically into the fire. “Did it have two beaty red eyes.”

Zajar nodded. “Scariest thing I’ve ever seen.”

He nodded. “How’s he doing?”

“I tore him a new one, but he’s still breathing, last I checked. He’ll probably end up being the second skeleton in that cave, unless he gets medical attention.”

“So it’s true.” Gra nodded.

“What?”

“The bacon is sizzling. Do you like it a little more raw or crispy?”

“Crispy please.”

“Very well.”

“Do you know that bear?”

Gra looked Zajar straight in the eye, and said… nothing. He went back to poking the bacon. “What can I do to repay your kindness? Besides the bacon, of course.”

“I could use some money for some new tools.”

“Ah, coin, that’s right. Uh…” Gra looked around the room. “I’ve probably got a few coins laying around in here somewhere. You can go searching for them if you want, I don’t have any use for them. The bacon’s gonna be awhile anyways.”

“Ok.” Zajar searched the ranch house. He explored into the master bedroom. It had a big bed enough for two, with sheets neatly placed. He looked under the bed: a copper coin! He plopped it into his shoulder bag. In the corner were a stack of folded sheets. He searched through them, but found nothing. He did his best to put them back in an orderly fashion. He came back to the living room. “Found a copper so far.”

“Lucky day!”

Zajar found a hallway with two shut doors. He opened the first door, and found a room covered in claw marks. A layer of dust coated everything: the walls, the floor, and the worn out bed. He blew some dust around, scoring a gold coin from under the bed.

Then he checked the second shut door. This one was locked.

“Hey, this door won’t open.”

“Oh, that’s Onortia’s room. She hid the key in here somewhere. If you find it, make sure to put it back in a different hiding place.”

“But how would she know where to find it then?”

Gra was silent.

Zajar shrugged. “Huh. Ok.”

He searched the kitchen. He found lots of cutlery and utensils, but no key. Then, in the cupboard, behind a pile of old knives, was a tiny wooden box. Inside was a metal key. “Found it.”

Gra poked at the bacon, fist clenched.

Zajar put the key in the lock, twisted it, and turned the door handle. The door bent in half as he pushed it open. Huge slashes on the outside of the door made it unstable. It was only now that Zajar realized the door wasn’t ever actually meaningfully locked, with how the door could just be caved in. But that wasn’t the biggest shock.

Like the other room, this one was covered in dust and cobwebs. But the bed in this room was in shambles. Splinters of it were spread across the floor, and it was straight up broken in two. Beneath the dust were traces of dried blood. The bed sheet, frame, and headboard were all stained in blood. It was bear’s blood.

Zajar gasped. He peeked outside the door to check on Gra, who was still silently poking the bacon.

Turning his attention back to the room, Zajar looked under the bed. There, hidden under a pile of dust, cobwebs, and bloodstained sheets, was a single silver coin. It cuddled up in his hand as he brought it into the daylight. A blue shimmer flashed across its face as Zajar examined it. He gently placed it in his shoulderbag.

Search complete, he reassembled the door to the best of his ability and relocked it. Key back in box, he went to the kitchen to hide it.

“Hey, let me see where you found it.”

Zajar showed him the hiding place behind the knives where he found it.

“Clever, I would have never thought to look there.” He looked for the box. “Where is it now?”

“I hid it.”

“Can you tell me—” Gra took a deep breath and turned away. “Nevermind. Don’t tell me.”

“Mr. Oathswan?”

He sat next to the campfire. “Bacon’s done.”

Zajar sat next to him.

“Want the first slice of Spices?”

“Sure.” Zajar crunched on the greasy bacon slice. “Hmm, crispy!”

“Find anything good?”

“A copper coin, a gold coin, and a silver.” Zajar presented them to him.

“Good find! I hope you can get yourself some good tools with that.”

“What about you? I’ve seen your tools. They’re pretty old.”

“Nah, those old things? I could sharpen them forever.”

“They’re getting pretty worn down.” Zajar plopped the copper and the gold into his hands. “Here, take these.”

“But—”

“My tools are fairly new anyways. Besides, the bacon is *plenty*.”

“But you’re taking the silver one?”

“Yes. There’s something… special about it.”

Gra took a deep breath. “She likes you. I’m glad. Can I see her for a second?”

Zajar set the silver coin in his hands.

He took the silver coin in his palm, and caressed it. He gave it a kiss and another hug. “You be good for Zajar here, you hear? He’ll take good care of you.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. Is that coin special to you?”

“No—I mean yes, but I want you to have it.” Gra took Zajar’s hand and opened it. He placed the silver coin in his palm, and slowly closed it, wrapping his hand around the coin.

Zajar sensed something… an energy, a presence, a spirit? He examined the coin. It was standard issue from the Cat Kingdom, minted several decades ago. For how old it was, it showed surprisingly little wear and tear. The neutral expression of the Cat Queen was just as detailed as the day it was made. It had a youthful energy to it. He held it up to the light, and a blue shimmer washed over it. He couldn’t tell how, but he knew this coin was special, and that he wanted it, and that *it* wanted him to want it, too.

“You know what she wanted to be when she grew up?” Gra took another deep breath and looked at a portrait on the wall. It showed four bears cuddling up for a big bear hug. “She wanted to be a veterinarian.”

Zajar nodded. He laid a hand on Gra’s shoulder. “I’ll take good care of her.”

Gra reached for a slice of bacon, but his hand stopped before it could reach his mouth.

“So, those rooms. They’re pretty empty.”

“Believe you me, they weren’t always empty.”

“I get that. But maybe it’s time to clean them up a bit. You’ve got a pretty nice place here. Maybe you could start a bed and breakfast?”

The rancher snorted a whiff of bacon. “You know, that’s not a bad idea. But where would I even start?”

“I’m not sure, but I can help you figure it out.”

“Thanks, but I don’t want to tie up anymore of your time.”

“No problem, I usually just wait around until I need to make another house call. Might as well stay somewhere I can be useful, you know?”

Gra chuckled. “Alright, Zajar, you got yourself a deal.”

Zajar smiled, looking into the face of the silver coin, which smiled back.
