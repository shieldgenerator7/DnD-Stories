# Cat

Base Features: Darkvision, Blindsight, Keen Hearing, Climbing speed

Species Ability: Heart Fire. Will yourself to succeed and light things on fire.

Virtue: Happiness

Languages: Common, Sign Language

## Backgrounds

Cat cities tend to be technologically advanced, letting their citizens delve into their desires more than other species.

Blacksmith – A cat with a strong Heart Fire can make a strong hearth fire, and excel at crafting weapons, armor, and tools. Each blacksmith has a special brand that they put on all their crafts.

Inventor – These cats have a passion for improving the lives of others, and will experiment until they make something that solves a problem for their people, and then move onto a new problem.

Mechanic – Someone’s gotta maintain all the inventions throughout the cities. Mechanics keep the machines running and often make tweaks to optimize them for new needs, in addition to retrofitting the machines when they get updates to their design.

Bard – These cats bring joy to their fellow citizens with songs of merriment and cheer. They can be found playing in the streets, in the bars, and even on the road.

Hermit – Some cats find comfort in solitude and choose to live life alone in the woods. These cats like to fish, sleep in trees, and hang out on sunny days.

Royal – The royal cat family is quite large, and many citizens boast having royal blood in their lines. These cats are afforded special privileges in the cat kingdom, including additional food, equipment, and servants. They often live care-free lives and get to do whatever their heart desires without consequence.

Spy – Cats are very good at being silent, and with the right equipment, can be virtually undetectable. Spies skulk among the enemy evesdropping on meetings, snooping in rooms stealing secrets, and undermining enemy alliances by planting controversial evidence.

Thief – When a cat sets its eyes on something, it doesn’t stop until it gets it. Thieves contrive elaborate plans to steal the most valuable of artifacts from the most secure vaults. Or, if they’re just petty, sneak into houses to take various valuables and sneak away.

Foot Soldier – Cats supposedly have nine lives, which come in handy on the battlefield. Foot soldiers very often spend all nine of them dying on the battlefield, making their allies’ weapons and items more powerful. Their equipment very often gives them an advantage in war.

Cartographer – Wanderlust strikes a lucky few, who embark on a lifelong adventure to explore and map the land. They leave their homelands for months at a time, even years, and some never come home at all. They feel right at home in the untamed wilderness.

Author – Passionate about their favorite subjects, they endeavor to find out everything they can about them. They write books upon books about the subject. Some authors write numerous volumes on the same topic, while others find inspiration to write from several different topics.

Lamplighter – The fun doesn’t have to stop at dusk. Lamplighters visit each street, lighting the lanterns aglow with their fire. They don’t have to do anything all day, but they have to move fast at sunset.

Shopkeeper – Some cats want to horde everything, but find they get more joy from trading. Shopkeepers buy and sell goods, usually relating to one specific type of thing. They do what they can to satisfy their customers, and very often have regulars who buy stuff just for the joy of buying.

# Wolf

Base Features: Darkvision, Keen Smell, Run Speed, Swim Speed

Species Ability: Hindsight. Look into the past.

Virtue: Loyalty

Languages: Common, Howl

## Backgrounds

Wolves tend to have combat-related professions

Guard – Their ability to detect danger and avoid attacks makes them ideal guards. Wolf Guards are highly regarded all throughout the land for their ability to deter would-be trespassers, assassins, and thieves.

Soldier – Wolves fighting in war win many battles. A single wolf can tear through half an army by itself, and when combined with its pack, a wolf army is near unstoppable.

Mercenary – Rarely will a wolf work for money. Wolves usually work for a cause they believe in, but some may be swayed by coin. The wolves that do mercenary work fight in wars, assassinate targets, and kill whoever their client wants.

Historian – Exceptional wolves can see so far back into the past that they can write history with first-hand experience. These wolves become scholars and consultants in a lot of fields.

Investigator – Being able to see into the past makes a wolf an excellent choice for figuring out what happened at a crime scene. They can easily vindicate innocent suspects and track down criminals.

Gladiator – A few wolves become popular in the arena, where they show off their fighting prowess in tournaments. These wolves tend to be loyal to their fans more than anything else.

Den Sitter – Younglings are hard to keep track, no matter the species. A wolf’s Hindsight makes it easy to tell where little pups, fawns, chicks, etc have run off to, and their combat prowess makes it easy to discipline little ones. Most den sitters keep in close contact with the little ones they watch as they grow up.

Scout – Wolves are fast and can cover large distances quickly. Scouts tend to have a higher ability to remember lots of details, and can track enemy movements easily. Reporting findings is easy with their long-range howl, helping generals plan for battles.

General – An experienced battle wolf is often put in a position of power to oversee combat operations. A good general knows where to place their troops to play to their strengths and maximize the chances of victory.

Town Crier – A disciplined wolf can easily keep track of the time of day with their Hindsight, down to the minute. Then, they howl at the start of every hour to let the townsfolk know what time it is.

Singer – Howling isn’t merely practical, but also an art form. Wolf singers can sing far and wide, inspiring all who hear with songs about loyalty, family, and the moon god.

Hunter – Wolves are carnivores, and someone has to go get the meat. Hunters track down their prey with Hindsight, catch up to them with their speed, and bring back their prey to share with their family.

Bounty Hunter – Show them a picture of the target, and they’ll have them hunted down within a day—dead or alive. Wolves are the most feared bounty hunters alive.

Messager – A network of howlposts run along the roads between villages, where howlers carry messages across vast distances that any one wolf would not be able to do alone. These outposts also serve as emergency stations, where any creature can stop and signal for help.

# Deer

Base Features: Darkvision, Keen Smell, Keen Hearing, Run Speed

Species Ability: Adirada’s Lie. Bend reality.

Species Passive (Male): Antlers. Wield a melee weapon with your face.

Virtue: Truth

Languages: Common, Antler Scratch

## Backgrounds

Most deer work on farms growing plants.

Gardener – Most deer villages have found various ways of speeding up plant growth cycles and increasing yield. Gardeners tend to the plants and keep them growing strong.

Gatherer – Plants need water to grow, and these deer find that water and bring it to them. They may also be responsible for finding plant food and bringing it to a common collection pile.

Composter – Recycling plant material takes a long time, but composters can speed up the process by breaking down the components manually. They tend to stink from their long hours next to the pile, but some individuals find it alluring.

Forester – Trees are plants too. Foresters wander the woods, helping the trees grow strong and healthy.

Ko – Each deer village has a Ko, or leader, that oversees the gardening and village activities. They also respond to requests from outsiders to correct “Adirada’s little mistakes” with permanent transformations to the requester’s body.

Slave – Deer are the most valuable and sought after forced laborers in the entire land due to their very useful, but seldom threatening, ability to freely alter reality. They are usually kidnapped from a deer village and forced to live far away in an entirely other village. These deer slaves grant their masters virtually anything they desire: gold, sweets, technology.

Thespians – Able to manipulate light as well as matter, thespians travel the land, delighting every village with their life-like illusions. They spread tails of heroes and stories of tragedies.

Scientist – Struck with a penchant to find the truth, these deer seek to understand the very nature of their world—and the universe. They travel the world looking for answers to their questions. Several deer devote their entire lives to answering a single, ever-expanding question.

Appraiser – It takes a reality bender to know when reality has been bent. Appraisers examine items to tell if they’ve been crafted manually or simply created by another deer.

Banker – Deer are very often the most honest species in the land, and a natural pick for storing valuables you want kept track of. Bankers accept assets, store them in vaults, and give them back at the client’s request. Bankers often spend their whole lives in the same location.

Judge – Resolving conflicts often requires getting to the heart of the truth, a talent especially suited for deer. A deer that can detect lies can also very easily make a judgement that best adheres to the law.

Decorator – Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and most beholders agree with a deer’s taste in décor. Decorators change the colors of buildings, decorate interiors, and make spaces more pleasurable to live in. These deer can achieve renown and are welcomed throughout the land.

Miracle Worker – Not all injuries heal over time. For those injuries, these deer have the answer. They heal wounds and injuries thought to be incurable, helping the blind see, the lame walk, and the mute speak.

# Bear

Base Features: Darkvision, Keen Smell, Keen Hearing, Climb Speed, Swim Speed

Species Ability: Bloodlust. Sense those that are injured and get bonuses against them.

Species Passive: Bear Hide. Use your size to your advantage.

Virtue: Compassion

Languages: Common

## Backgrounds

Bears work with animals most of the time.

Rancher – Most bear villages trade in livestock. They raise, breed, and slaughter livestock species like cows, pigs, chickens, etc. This is a major trade good for them. They also herd sheep for their wool.

Medic – Bears are very often trained in medicine, and given Garaftle’s Blessing, which allows them to do a great bit of healing. Most bear medics live in other villages, where they serve as the main medic.

Veterinarian – A bear trained in medicine might pursue a career in taking care of sick and injured animals, traveling from village to village making house calls for the various livestock and pets that find themselves in unfortunate situations.

Monster – When a bear gives in to their desire to eat and consume flesh, they lose themselves to this insatiable goal, becoming a monster scarier than any feral beast. They tend to be quickly hunted down, but rumors say some escaped to the mountains.

Counselor – Their natural inclination towards empathy allows them to help others understand their situation in a different light, and help them navigate it to improve their lives.

Mediator – Combining their empathy with their ability to enforce rules, many bears have helped end armed conflicts and achieve some sort of peace between former enemies.

Deliveries – Their strength makes them suited to carrying large packages from one town to another.

Bodyguards – Fools tend to see bears as the perfect body guard, but their bloodlust usually ends up killing the very ones who hired them. Still, some seek to employ a bear for personal safety.

Butcher – Working with meat is a bear’s delight. Butchers know exactly where to cut to get the most meat out of their livestock.

# Peacock

Base Features: Flight Speed

Species Ability (Male): The Eye. Turn things to stone.

## Backgrounds (Male)

Peacocks are masters of their art. “If you do, per*fect*.”

Artist – Peacocks will make an art out of anything, and master it too.

Idol – Peacock feathers are the prettiest thing in the land, and those who have it, flaunt it. They spend all day swarmed by adoring fans and pruning themselves to stay beautiful.

Peafo Fighter – Peacocks trained in the way of Peafo are quick and light on their feet, and can defeat any foe in a duel.

Crafter – Making objects meant to last isn’t easy, and many pieces take a month or more to finish. Crafters create art pieces that are unique to stand the test of time.

Preserver – Objects in stone don’t age. Preservers petrify objects—and sometimes creatures—to allow them a safe journey into the future.

Inspector – Peacocks have an eye for perfection, and things that are imperfect stick out like a sore thumb. Inspectors can tell at a glance whether or not something is up to the standards, and what can be done about it.

# Beaver

Base Features: Swim Speed

Species Ability: Lazy Beaver’s Crutch. Move things with your mind.

Virtue: Hard Work

## Backgrounds

Beavers are very industrious, and tend to keep their hands busy.

Builder – Beavers build dams, homes, and other buildings. Builders use stone, wood, and metal to erect structures.

Patcher – Buildings don’t last forever, but Patchers make sure they last a little longer. These beavers fix cracks in walls, refurbish sidings, and plug holes.

Assembler – Putting together the same parts over and over is time consuming, but these beavers work hard until the job is done. They accomplish repetitive tasks with a speed unmatched by any other species.

Lumberjack – Beaver teeth are super effective at cutting down trees. Lumberjacks cut down trees and carry logs to the river, where they are transported to a nearby buildsite.

Base Features: Blindsight, Tremorsense, Climb Speed

Species Ability: Web Spinner. Spin webs and cast Spider-specific spells.

Species Passive (Female): Spiderette. Gain bonuses and spell power.

Virtue: Safety

Languages: Common, Morse

## Backgrounds

Spiders are reclusive, so their jobs tend to be solitary.

Archivist – Spiders keep lots of secrets hidden away. It’s the Archivist’s duty to store them in the proper place, and keep track of what is hidden where.

Sentry – These spiders deny entry to trespassers, which is pretty much everyone. They set traps and spook intruders into running away.

Trapper – Food is scarce, but it can be found. Trappers set traps designed to catch prey, which is then eaten.

Mage – These spiders spend a lifetime learning the magic of the web. They use their webs to cast spells.

Seamstress – Spider silk is strong. These spiders use their silk—and that of others—to weave robes that spiders can wear. Clothing made of spider silk is a major trade good for the spiders.

Telecomms – These spiders transit signals across the web to warn other spiders of approaching danger. They also transmit messages to coordinate with other spiders.

Exile – Spiders deemed to dangerous to live in the web are expelled, doomed to wander the lands on their own. Most exiles die within a month of leaving.

Ambassador – These brave spiders venture out into the world to represent spider kind in the political round table of the species.

Culler – There’s not always enough to feed everyone. Luckily, those that are weak make great snacks. The cullers ensure all spiders in the web can be fed by feeding on those who cannot be fed.

Digger – The web isn’t going to expand itself. These spiders create new tunnels and maintain existing ones.

Queen – Most spiders lay eggs occasionally, but queens lay eggs constantly. They very often have entire chambers dedicated to just their eggs.

Fetcher – Trade outposts are left vacant, except for the regular trips made by the fetchers. They bring trade goods to the outpost and take back trade goods to the web.

Poisoner – Some spiders secrete toxic venom. They extract it from themselves so other spiders or species can use it for their own means. This is a major trade good for the spiders.

Warner – Some tunnels are dangerous. Warners write caution signs on the walls to tell other spiders what is safe and what is not safe.

Drell Hunter Gatherer – Hunt prey and find food under the snow in the mountainous wilderness.
