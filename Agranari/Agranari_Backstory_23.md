# 23’s Backstory

# Version 1 – 23 (Peacock)

A trio of wolves stood by outside a fence, watching the little deer fawns play in the play area.

They chased each other, climbed ledges, scrambled across obstacles, and giggled and screamed like there’s no tomorrow. The fawns sometimes fell or tripped, but got right back up on their two legs all on their own.

A gaggle of does watched from a shady area, watching the wolves watch the fawns.

The tallest wolf, who was also the one with an eyeball-sized bald bump on his forehead, pointed to one of the fawns and said, “That one.”

The other two wolves hopped the fence.

“This is a kidnapping,” declared the tall wolf.

A shading doe sighed. “How many this time?”

“Just that one. Unless you’d like to come too?”

The doe flipped him off, and his muzzle began to seal itself shut.

“Got the fawn, boss.” The two wolves returned with the fawn, punching and kicking. They had both been discolored, as if someone had dumped paint all over them.

The tall wolf pointed to the doe, and then to his mouth. “Hmmph!”

One of the wolves facepalmed and walked to the doe. “Your hoof please.”

The doe snapped off the end of her hoof like you would a chocolate bar. “Don’t give it to him until you’re back home.”

“Will do, mam.” The wolf held his hand out.

“Promise.”

“I promise to keep the hoof until I get back home.”

“And that you’ll keep it safe until then.”

“And I promise I’ll keep it safe until then.”

The doe wedged the hoof clipping into the wolf’s hand, in such a way to cause the most pain.

“Good day.” The wolf nodded as he rejoined his comrades. “Sorry, sir. I made a promise to keep this hoof clipping.”

The tall wolf looked cross. He would’ve yelled if he could open his mouth.

The three wolves left, carrying the struggling fawn with them. By the time they got to their destination, they and all their belongings were mono-colored. They clipped the fawn’s hooves as fast as they could, but this little guy was determined to get away. Finally, they got to the slave trading market, where they met their client.

“Who have you brought me this time?” A fancy-looking peacock asked.

“A very promising young fawn.” The wolf said.

“Why are you all blue? Don’t you know how to handle a fawn?”

“This is less an indicator of our incompetence and more of an indicator of his talent.”

The peacock’s eyes lit up. “Ooh! Give him here.” The peacock grabbed the fawn by the wrist.

The fawn shot his middle hoof straight up, and the peacock turned wholly blue in an instant.

“I like this color. And the speed at which he does it—I’m in awe. How much for him?”

The wolf and peacock negotiate a price and the wolves leave.

Back at home, the peacock held the fawn’s hand up. He raised his tail, showing the fawn his grey eye feather. A beam of grey soot blasted from his tail, hitting the fawn’s hand dead on. The peacock did the same to the other hand. The fawn’s middle hooves were both petrified, and he was unable to move them. He grabbed the peacock, but the peacock didn’t turn blue.

“Can’t have you bending until broken.” The peacock smiled. He turned the fawn around and sprayed rock on his back. His back was now partially petrified, in the shape of the peacock’s sigil. “You will be a perfect addition to my collection.” The peacock clapped.

Six grown deer entered the room in a single file, and stopped in an exact spot demarked on the floor. Each stood tall on two legs, staring forward.

“Meet 2, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19.” The peacock gestured to the six deer. “Welcome to your new home, 23.”

23 the fawn spends the next 4 years training under the peacock, and doing manual labor tasks that go by much faster because of the fawn’s powers. The other six deer train him in all the skills they know, but are otherwise cold to him.

The fawn gets acquainted with his new home, but desires to go home. He escapes multiple times, but always manages to get caught. Finally, one day, he comes up with a new plan, and actually gets outside the perimeter of the peacock town, something he had never done before.

Heart racing, he makes the biggest break for his life he had ever done before.

# Version 2 – ze -\> Zemorsin (Wolf)

The sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a perfect day to run around on all fours and butt heads with fellow deer.

All the little bucks ran around in an enclosed area surrounded on all sides by dirt walls protruding out of the ground. On the outer wall, several does lounged on their backs in dirt mounds shaped specifically for lounging. Their seats laid in the shade, and they fanned themselves with enlarged webbed hooves. They talked amongst themselves as the fawns played.

The male fawns, despite not having antlers, butted heads. They jousted with the front of their skulls, running at each other in full force.

One such fawn suddenly grew larger, and its muscles bulged. Its skull hardened. It pawed its middle hoof, which had grown longer, into the ground, snapping it off. It charged full force at an opposing, younger fawn. It bulldozed the other fawn, trampling it into the ground. It then couldn’t stop itself, it ran straight into the dirt barrier, bursting its head through, and getting it stuck!

“ze! Play nice with the me!” One of the does yelled from her perch.

ze tried to pull his head out of the dirt barrier, but was stuck. “Bleeat!” He cried out.

“I got this one,” the same doe said to the other does. She lifted her middle hoof, causing it to grow. A grass blade grew out of the ground and crushed ze’s hoof clipping in two.

ze immediately shrunk back to his smaller size, easily pulling himself out of the hole. “Bleat!” He said happily.

“You’re welcome. Now, play nice.”

ze looked around for the fawn he had been playing with, but it was being carried out of the play area by one of the does.

She walked on two legs, picked up the “me”, and carried it all the way out, caressing its head. “You poor, poor thing.” She whispered to it.

ze cried out, “Bleat!” but she didn’t bring him back.

Suddenly a strange smell wafted in on the breeze.

AWOOO!

A trio of wolves approached the play area.

“Hello, ladies.” The tallest wolf said. He had a glowing white bump on his forehead, and his eyes were rolled back into his skull. “This is a kidnapping.”

“They sent you again, Shrulot?” The doe that helped ze snarked.

“I sent myself. Couldn’t pass up an opportunity to see you again, udu.” He smiled at her, licking his lips.

“That’s enough.” She raised her middle hoof to the wolf, and his top teeth grew around his bottom jaw, gripping around it like a rib cage.

Shrulot tried to talk, but he couldn’t get his mouth open wide enough to do any more than grunt.

“Just take your prize and go.”

“Which one’ll it be today?” One of the wolves asked Shrulot.

“You can take a ze, but the little mes still need breastfed.”

Shrulot growled in discomfort, but he focused on his job. His bald spot stopped glowing and his eyes returned to normal. He pointed to ze.

ze was head butting the barrier between him and the wolf, buffing himself up to do more damage.

“What’s this one?”

“That’s a ze.”

“We’ll take him.” The assistant wolf lept into the play area, grabbed ze from behind, and picked him up.

ze made himself bigger and heavier, but the wolf didn’t let go. No matter how much ze struggled and buffed himself, he couldn’t break free.

The wolf carried him to the does. “Approved?”

ze looked at the doe that took care of him. “Bleat! Bleat!” He looked into her eyes.

“Hey, it’s alright.” She stroked his head as a tear fell from her eye. As she ran her hand down his neck, his fur got thicker, and whiter. “You’ve got a purpose now. Be good and live a good life.” She kissed him on the thick forehead.

The wolf held out his hand.

“Here’s yours.” She snapped off her hoof and placed it in the wolf’s hand. “And here’s his.” She smiled slyly as she held up another hoof clipping. “Promise me you’ll keep it until you get home.”

“I promise.”

“Promise what?”

“I promise I’ll keep it until I get home.”

“Good.” She let him have the hoof clipping.

The wolf carried ze to the other two wolves, then they left as a group. They carried ze many miles. They brought him to a wolf village.

“Zemorsin.” An adult deer approached the young fawn. He stood over him, with a white-furred chest and a glorious pair of antlers.

Zemorsin looked up at the deer. “Bleat?”

The deer pulled him into a dark corner, with their backs to the light.

“Take this, and keep it safe.” The deer stuck a sharp, pointy object in Zemorsin’s hand.

Zemorsin examined it. It was a hoof clipping. Along the side, the name “ZEMORSIN” was etched into its side. “It me!”

“Yes, now hang onto it. When the time is right, you’ll know what to do with it.”

Zemorsin nodded and stuck it in his fur.
