23’s Backstory

A trio of wolves stood by outside a fence, watching the little deer fawns play in the play area.

They chased each other, climbed ledges, scrambled across obstacles, and giggled and screamed like there’s no tomorrow. The fawns sometimes fell or tripped, but got right back up on their two legs all on their own.

A gaggle of does watched from a shady area, watching the wolves watch the fawns.

The tallest wolf, who was also the one with an eyeball-sized bald bump on his forehead, pointed to one of the fawns and said, “That one.”

The other two wolves hopped the fence.

“This is a kidnapping,” declared the tall wolf.

A shading doe sighed. “How many this time?”

“Just that one. Unless you’d like to come too?”

The doe flipped him off, and his muzzle began to seal itself shut.

“Got the fawn, boss.” The two wolves returned with the fawn, punching and kicking. They had both been discolored, as if someone had dumped paint all over them.

The tall wolf pointed to the doe, and then to his mouth. “Hmmph!”

One of the wolves facepalmed and walked to the doe. “Your hoof please.”

The doe snapped off the end of her hoof like you would a chocolate bar. “Don’t give it to him until you’re back home.”

“Will do, mam.” The wolf held his hand out.

“Promise.”

“I promise to keep the hoof until I get back home.”

“And that you’ll keep it safe until then.”

“And I promise I’ll keep it safe until then.”

The doe wedged the hoof clipping into the wolf’s hand, in such a way to cause the most pain.

“Good day.” The wolf nodded as he rejoined his comrades. “Sorry, sir. I made a promise to keep this hoof clipping.”

The tall wolf looked cross. He would’ve yelled if he could open his mouth.

The three wolves left, carrying the struggling fawn with them. By the time they got to their destination, they and all their belongings were mono-colored. They clipped the fawn’s hooves as fast as they could, but this little guy was determined to get away. Finally, they got to the slave trading market, where they met their client.

“Who have you brought me this time?” A fancy-looking peacock asked.

“A very promising young fawn.” The wolf said.

“Why are you all blue? Don’t you know how to handle a fawn?”

“This is less an indicator of our incompetence and more of an indicator of his talent.”

The peacock’s eyes lit up. “Ooh! Give him here.” The peacock grabbed the fawn by the wrist.

The fawn shot his middle hoof straight up, and the peacock turned wholly blue in an instant.

“I like this color. And the speed at which he does it—I’m in awe. How much for him?”

The wolf and peacock negotiate a price and the wolves leave.

Back at home, the peacock held the fawn’s hand up. He raised his tail, showing the fawn his grey eye feather. A beam of grey soot blasted from his tail, hitting the fawn’s hand dead on. The peacock did the same to the other hand. The fawn’s middle hooves were both petrified, and he was unable to move them. He grabbed the peacock, but the peacock didn’t turn blue.

“Can’t have you bending until broken.” The peacock smiled. He turned the fawn around and sprayed rock on his back. His back was now partially petrified, in the shape of the peacock’s sigil. “You will be a perfect addition to my collection.” The peacock clapped.

Six grown deer entered the room in a single file, and stopped in an exact spot demarked on the floor. Each stood tall on two legs, staring forward.

“Meet 2, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19.” The peacock gestured to the six deer. “Welcome to your new home, 23.”

23 the fawn spends the next 4 years training under the peacock, and doing manual labor tasks that go by much faster because of the fawn’s powers. The other six deer train him in all the skills they know, but are otherwise cold to him.

The fawn gets acquainted with his new home, but desires to go home. He escapes multiple times, but always manages to get caught. Finally, one day, he comes up with a new plan, and actually gets outside the perimeter of the peacock town, something he had never done before.

Heart racing, he makes the biggest break for his life he had ever done before.
