## Features

Heart Fire – You have a pool of firepoints to spend each long rest. Whenever you spend a firepoint, you take fire damage equal to your Firecost for each firepoint spent.

Burnout – Whenever you reach 0 firepoints for the first time each long rest, you lose -1 max health.

Heartfire Will – Whenever you must roll a d20, you may spend any number of firepoints to gain a bonus equal to the number of firepoints \* your Willpower.

Flame Strike – Whenever you hit something with a weapon attack, you can spend firepoints to deal extra fire damage to the target: fire damage equal to the number of firepoints spent \* your Firedamage

Ignite – As an action, target a creature or object within your fire target max range. Deal your fire damage to it. They must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = Fire ignite DC) or become ignited.

Flash Fire – At the start of your turn, if there are targets that you Ignited and are on fire, the fire spreads in all directions a distance equal to your FireSpreadPerRound.

Cauterize – When you Ignite a creature, instead of dealing damage, you can instead cauterize its wounds: you heal it for your heal power, remove a status effect from it, and prevent all healing for that creature for a number of rounds equal to your Firepower.

Passion – Whenever you make a roll related to your heart’s one true passion, you gain advantage on it.

Heat Metal – When you Ignite an object made of metal, you can melt it given enough time.

You can perceive their message as long as you can see them, have line of sight, and are within your Vision Range of them. Your Vision Range isn’t effected by nonmagical darkness.
