## Backgrounds

Cat cities tend to be technologically advanced, letting their citizens delve into their desires more than other species.

Blacksmith – A cat with a strong Heart Fire can make a strong hearth fire, and excel at crafting weapons, armor, and tools. Each blacksmith has a special brand that they put on all their crafts.

Inventor – These cats have a passion for improving the lives of others, and will experiment until they make something that solves a problem for their people, and then move onto a new problem.

Mechanic – Someone’s gotta maintain all the inventions throughout the cities. Mechanics keep the machines running and often make tweaks to optimize them for new needs, in addition to retrofitting the machines when they get updates to their design.

Bard – These cats bring joy to their fellow citizens with songs of merriment and cheer. They can be found playing in the streets, in the bars, and even on the road.

Hermit – Some cats find comfort in solitude and choose to live life alone in the woods. These cats like to fish, sleep in trees, and hang out on sunny days.

Royal – The royal cat family is quite large, and many citizens boast having royal blood in their lines. These cats are afforded special privileges in the cat kingdom, including additional food, equipment, and servants. They often live care-free lives and get to do whatever their heart desires without consequence.

Spy – Cats are very good at being silent, and with the right equipment, can be virtually undetectable. Spies skulk among the enemy evesdropping on meetings, snooping in rooms stealing secrets, and undermining enemy alliances by planting controversial evidence.

Thief – When a cat sets its eyes on something, it doesn’t stop until it gets it. Thieves contrive elaborate plans to steal the most valuable of artifacts from the most secure vaults. Or, if they’re just petty, sneak into houses to take various valuables and sneak away.

Foot Soldier – Cats supposedly have nine lives, which come in handy on the battlefield. Foot soldiers very often spend all nine of them dying on the battlefield, making their allies’ weapons and items more powerful. Their equipment very often gives them an advantage in war.

Cartographer – Wanderlust strikes a lucky few, who embark on a lifelong adventure to explore and map the land. They leave their homelands for months at a time, even years, and some never come home at all. They feel right at home in the untamed wilderness.

Author – Passionate about their favorite subjects, they endeavor to find out everything they can about them. They write books upon books about the subject. Some authors write numerous volumes on the same topic, while others find inspiration to write from several different topics.

Lamplighter – The fun doesn’t have to stop at dusk. Lamplighters visit each street, lighting the lanterns aglow with their fire. They don’t have to do anything all day, but they have to move fast at sunset.

Shopkeeper – Some cats want to horde everything, but find they get more joy from trading. Shopkeepers buy and sell goods, usually relating to one specific type of thing. They do what they can to satisfy their customers, and very often have regulars who buy stuff just for the joy of buying.

## Features

Hind Sight – As an action, you may activate your Hind Sight to look into the past. You can go back as far as your HindSightRewindSpeed, in the units of your HindSightUnit. If your Hind Sight is already active, you may use 1 free action to go further back in time an additional amount up to your HindSightMaxRewind speed. Alternatively, you may use that 1 free action to come back to the present, at a rate up to your HindSightForwardSpeed. If you go forward to catch up to the present, your Hind Sight ends. Taking damage and falling unconscious does not end your Hind Sight. During Hind Sight, you see from your location, but in the past. This only effects your vision; your ears, nose, and other senses all perceive the present. Time moves forward, even in the past, because your Hind Sight is relative to your current position in time.

Scene Reconstruction – Whenever you roll Investigation to investigate events that have happened recently within your HindSightMaxRewind duration, you gain advantage.

Crit Pointing – Whenever you land a crit against an opponent, you gain 1 crit range against that opponent until end of combat.

Battle Mercy – You gain bonus AC against opponents that are blinded, prone, or grappled.

Lick Wounds – As an action, lick your wounds or the wounds of a target creature. Heal the target for 1d4. If your Adrenaline Rush is active, increase the healing by an additional 1d10. Your Adrenaline Rush ends.

Howl – As an action, encode a short message into a howl. The message can be heard up to 1 mile away. If you hear a howl, you understand that howl’s message, and may also be able to pinpoint where the howl came from and who sent the howl.

Quick Attack – As a reaction, hit a target within your reach with a melee attack. If you hit your attack, you may counter the action, bonus action, or movement you reacted to instead of dealing damage.

## Backgrounds

Wolves tend to have combat-related professions

Guard – Their ability to detect danger and avoid attacks makes them ideal guards. Wolf Guards are highly regarding all throughout the land for their ability to deter would-be trespassers, assassins, and thieves.

Soldier – Wolves fighting in war win many battles. A single wolf can tear through half an army by itself, and when combined with its pack, a wolf army is near unstoppable.

Mercenary – Rarely will a wolf work for money. Wolves usually work for a cause they believe in, but some may be swayed by coin. The wolves that do mercenary work fight in wars, assassinate targets, and kill whoever their client wants.

Historian – Exceptional wolves can see so far back into the past that they can write history with first-hand experience. These wolves become scholars and consultants in a lot of fields.

Investigator – Being able to see into the past makes a wolf an excellent choice for figuring out what happened at a crime scene. They can easily vindicate innocent suspects and track down criminals.

Gladiator – A few wolves become popular in the arena, where they show off their fighting prowess in tournaments. These wolves tend to be loyal to their fans more than anything else.

Den Sitter – Younglings are hard to keep track, no matter the species. A wolf’s Hindsight makes it easy to tell where little pups, fawns, chicks, etc have run off to, and their combat prowess makes it easy to discipline little ones. Most den sitters keep in close contact with the little ones they watch as they grow up.

Scout – Wolves are fast and can cover large distances quickly. Scouts tend to have a higher ability to remember lots of details, and can track enemy movements easily. Reporting findings is easy with their long-range howl, helping generals plan for battles.

General – An experienced battle wolf is often put in a position of power to oversee combat operations. A good general knows where to place their troops to play to their strengths and maximize the chances of victory.

Town Crier – A disciplined wolf can easily keep track of the time of day with their Hindsight, down to the minute. Then, they howl at the start of every hour to let the townsfolk know what time it is.

Singer – Howling isn’t merely practical, but also an art form. Wolf singers can sing far and wide, inspiring all who hear with songs about loyalty, family, and the moon god.

Hunter – Wolves are carnivores, and someone has to go get the meat. Hunters track down their prey with Hindsight, catch up to them with their speed, and bring back their prey to share with their family.

## Backgrounds

Most deer work on farms growing plants.

Gardener – Most deer villages have found various ways of speeding up plant growth cycles and increasing yield. Gardeners tend to the plants and keep them growing strong.

Gatherer – Plants need water to grow, and these deer find that water and bring it to them. They may also be responsible for finding plant food and bringing it to a common collection pile.

Composter – Recycling plant material takes a long time, but composters can speed up the process by breaking down the components manually. They tend to stink from their long hours next to the pile, but some individuals find it alluring.

Forester – Trees are plants too. Foresters wander the woods, helping the trees grow strong and healthy.

Ko – Each deer village has a Ko, or leader, that oversees the gardening and village activities. They also respond to requests from outsiders to correct “Adirada’s little mistakes” with permanent transformations to the requester’s body.

Slave – Deer are the most valuable and sought after forced laborers in the entire land due to their very useful, but seldom threatening, ability to freely alter reality. They are usually kidnapped from a deer village and forced to live far away in an entirely other village. These deer slaves grant their masters virtually anything they desire: gold, sweets, technology.

Thespians – Able to manipulate light as well as matter, thespians travel the land, delighting every village with their life-like illusions. They spread tails of heroes and stories of tragedies.

Scientist – Struck with a penchant to find the truth, these deer seek to understand the very nature of their world—and the universe. They travel the world looking for answers to their questions. Several deer devote their entire lives to answering a single, ever-expanding question.

Appraiser – It takes a reality bender to know when reality has been bent. Appraisers examine items to tell if they’ve been crafted manually or simply created by another deer.

Banker – Deer are very often the most honest species in the land, and a natural pick for storing valuables you want kept track of. Bankers accept assets, store them in vaults, and give them back at the client’s request. Bankers often spend their whole lives in the same location.

Judge – Resolving conflicts often requires getting to the heart of the truth, a talent especially suited for deer. A deer that can detect lies can also very easily make a judgement that best adheres to the law.

Decorator – Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and most beholders agree with a deer’s taste in décor. Decorators change the colors of buildings, decorate interiors, and make spaces more pleasurable to live in. These deer can achieve renown and are welcomed throughout the land.

## Backgrounds

Bears work with animals most of the time.

-   HealPerDamage: Advantage x1

Medic – Bears are very often trained in medicine, and given Garaftle’s Blessing, which allows them to do a great bit of healing. Most bear medics live in other villages, where they serve as the main medic.

-   BloodlustPower: Advantage x2
-   DamageRequiredPerBonus: Advantage x2
-   Wisdom: Disadvantage x2

## Backgrounds

Spiders are reclusive, so their jobs tend to be solitary.

Archivist – Spiders keep lots of secrets hidden away. It’s the Archivist’s duty to store them in the proper place, and keep track of what is hidden where.

Sentry – These spiders deny entry to trespassers, which is pretty much everyone. They set traps and spook intruders into running away.

Trapper – Food is scarce, but it can be found. Trappers set traps designed to catch prey, which is then eaten.

Mage – These spiders spend a lifetime learning the magic of the web. They use their webs to cast spells.

Seamstress – Spider silk is strong. These spiders use their silk—and that of others—to weave robes that spiders can wear. Clothing made of spider silk is a major trade good for the spiders.

Culler – There’s not always enough to feed everyone. Luckily, those that are weak make great snacks. The cullers ensure all spiders in the web can be fed by feeding on those who cannot be fed.

Digger – The web isn’t going to expand itself. These spiders create new tunnels and maintain existing ones.

Queen – Most spiders lay eggs occasionally, but queens lay eggs constantly. They very often have entire chambers dedicated to just their eggs.

Fetcher – Trade outposts are left vacant, except for the regular trips made by the fetchers. They bring trade goods to the outpost and take back trade goods to the web.

Poisoner – Some spiders secrete toxic venom. They extract it from themselves so other spiders or species can use it for their own means. This is a major trade good for the spiders.

Warner – Some tunnels are dangerous. Warners write caution signs on the walls to tell other spiders what is safe and what is not safe.
