2023-07-19: originally copied from: <https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Blacksmith_(5e_Class)>

Whether it be for a weapon, armor, or something as simple as a new screwdriver, a capable blacksmith can create just about anything.

### Professional Forging

When you start, you already have a knack for smithing. Your base rate of pay is 10gp per working day with a tool you are proficient with and 5gp per working day for a tool you are not proficient with. A working day is defined as 8 hours. You get more pay as you level up, as defined in Gold/Day column of the Blacksmith’s table. Your base rate of pay per day is listed in that column. You get your base rate of pay with a tool you are proficient with, and half as much with a tool you aren’t proficient with.

### A Blacksmith’s Eyes

Due to your ability to create, and your history of forging thousands of weapons, your eyes have adapted to spot imperfections in armor. As an action, you can point out the weaknesses of an enemy’s armor. Roll a 1d6. All weapon attacks that target that enemy have their crit range increased by that amount until end of combat.

This feature cannot find weaknesses against unarmored opponents or opponents with natural armor.

### Blacksmithing Expertise

At 2nd level, you begin to develop a greater understanding of the weapons and armor around you. By spending 6 hours carefully analyzing the blueprints and the item itself, you develop an understanding of the particular weapon, allowing you to wield the weapon with proficiency. With the diagram within 10ft of view, you can use your innate blacksmithing abilities to replicate the design of the weapon as long as you have the relevant materials.

In addition, you have proficiency in all items made by you.

### Smith Mastery

At 3rd level, your experience has given you a broader perspective of what can be done with smithing. You can choose a style of smithing you wish to master, from Arcane Forge, Metal Master, or Huntsmith. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels. The features granted by your choice are detailed at the end of this page.

### Ability Score Increase

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As usual, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Blacksmithing Creations

At 6th level, your knowledge of materials and weapon and armor designs have begun to reach an impressive point allowing you to design weapons and armor that would give you various effects. For example, cloaks made of chameleon leather increase Deception rolls by +1, or spears made by a tiger’s tooth add +1 damage to piercing attacks. The effects and possibilities are up to your imagination, and the DM decides whether the item is plausible or not.

### Long Hours

At 9th level, you begin to feel your best when working at the forge. When you are at a blacksmith forge, you can work for any number of hours in a day without feeling exhausted. The effects of this feature only work if all you do is smithing during this day besides eating. In addition, any items you make during this day are worth twice as much.

### Advanced Forging

At 10th level, you have become more adept at your smithing. With the help of a magician present, you have developed the ability to infuse items forged by you with magical powers. Through this process, spells or effects can be infused into the item.

The cost of said creation is based on the power, rarity, and overall usefulness of the item and is left to the DM's discretion.

The spells infused into the item will have a certain amount of uses before needing to be re-infused with magical power determined by the Magician’s Level divided by four, rounded down with a minimum of 1.

### Advanced Improvement

At 11th level, your skills for improving equipment have grown profoundly. When you forge any weapon, armor, or piece of ammunition, you can permanently increase the weapon's attack bonus by +1 or the armor’s AC by +1. The effects of this feature do not stack.

As you level up, these bonuses increase at 13th level (+2), 17th level (+3), and 20th level (+4).

### Experienced Smith

At 14th level, you have become very proficient at your smithing. You no longer need a magician present in order to imbue any effects you have previously learned.

The cost of said creation is based on the item's power, rarity, and overall usefulness and is left to the DM's discretion.

The spells infused into the item will have a certain amount of uses before needing to be re-infused with magical power determined by your level divided by two, rounded down.

### Guild Master

At 16th level, your fame travels the world, causing many of the merchants and blacksmiths to take an interest in your items and forging techniques, in admiration, respect, or envy.

Every time you buy new resources for yourself, some events are unlocked for you depending on the shopkeeper's opinion about you, as well as some discounts, paying for products with some kind of service (related to the forge), or being able to set absurd prices for the simplest products.

### Masterful Forging

At 18th level, you have become a master of your craft. You no longer need magicians present in order to imbue any effects you have previously learned.

The cost of said creation is based on the item's power, rarity, and overall usefulness and is left to the DM's discretion.

The spells infused into the item no longer have a certain amount of uses before needing to be re-infused with magical power.

### Magnum Opus

At 18th level, your years of honing your craft have led you to create a masterpiece so great that it will eclipse all your other work for the rest of time.

You can work with your DM to determine the type of item and its effects.

This can only be used once.

Your dedication and focus on your profession are finally starting to pay off after so many years. At level 20th your Strength and Intelligence scores increase by 4 points and now your max skill points for those skills increases to 24.
