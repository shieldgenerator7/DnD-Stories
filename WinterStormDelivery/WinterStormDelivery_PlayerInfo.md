# Winter Storm Delivery

D&D 5e Adventure

## Premise

You play as deer pulling a delivery sled to a peninsula about to be frozen over by a blizzard. The cargo you carry will ensure the people of the frozen land can survive the winter storm. How will you survive the blizzard and make all the deliveries?

## Info

This adventure will focus more on exploration and resource management, with some combat and roleplaying. Each player will have a new resource: Stamina. This is used to determine how far you can travel in a day. Each of the 6 core attributes will have bonus effects that influence your stamina and how much you use, and this will effect your build decisions.

This adventure is inspired by *Rudolph, the Red-Blooded Paindeer* adventure from the DM’s Secret Weapon magazine, Dec 2023 issue (\#24). It was created by William Earl and Doug Wallace. This adventure uses some monster stat blocks, puzzles, and other elements from that adventure.
