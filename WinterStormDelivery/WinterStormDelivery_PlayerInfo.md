# Rules

This module is going to be a lot about exploration, route planning, and resource management. Your character has the following new resource: Stamina.

## Short Rest

A short rest is 12 minutes, during which you can eat 1 reindeer ration. A reindeer ration restores 25% of your max stamina.

A short rest is usually when you switch leaders.

You may only take a short rest while on the ground or on a boat.

## Stamina

Stamina is how far you can travel in a long rest. Under normal conditions, you spend 1 stamina to travel 1 mile at normal pace. Thus that means you can normally go 1 mile per 1 stamina (mps). If you want to conserve your stamina and travel further, you want a higher mps.

Managing your stamina is very important. It’s the resource that lets you pull the sleigh. If you run out of stamina, you are no longer able to contribute to pulling the sleigh until you regain it.

Your mps is lower when you travel:

-   Faster than your comfy speed
-   Across difficult terrain
-   Uphill
-   Into a head wind
-   With more weight than your comfy carry capacity
-   In the front while flying
-   In the back while walking
-   By swimming

Your mps is higher when you travel:

-   Slower than your comfy speed
-   Across easy terrain
-   Downhill
-   Out of a tail wind
-   With less weight than your comfy carry capacity
-   In the back while flying
-   In the front while walking
-   By boat

## Attribute Effects on Stamina

Your attribute scores effect your stamina:

-   STR – Increases your carrying capacity
-   DEX – Increases your mps
-   CON – Increases your max stamina
-   INT – Increases the distance you can navigate\*
-   WIS – Increases the chance you will see upcoming danger\*
-   CHA – Increases the morale boost you provide for your team\*

\*only applicable while you’re the leader

### Stat Formulas

Mark these stats on your character sheet:

-   Carrying capacity (lbs) = 100 \* STR + 300
-   Miles Per Stamina (MPS) = 3 + DEX
-   Stamina\* = 50 \* CON + 50
-   Navigation Distance (mi) = 5 \* INT + 10
-   Encounter DC = 8 + PB + WIS
-   Leadership = 0.25 \* CHA + 0.75

\* Refreshes on a long rest

### Carrying Capacity

Your mps scales inversely with the weight you’re carrying. While carrying a load that weighs as much as your carrying capacity, your mps is normal. While carrying a load that’s twice your carrying capacity, your mps is halved. While carrying a load that’s half your carrying capacity or less, your mps is increased by your DEX.

### Miles Per Stamina

For 1 point of stamina, you can travel this many miles.

### Max Stamina

This is the maximum amount of stamina you can have. A long rest gives you back full stamina.

### Navigation Distance

While you are leading, you navigate. This is how far ahead you can navigate per navigation check. After you travel this far, you will have to roll another navigation check.

### Encounter DC

While you are leading, the DM has to beat this Encounter DC for you to get ambushed. If the DM fails this check, there might still be an encounter, but you will be able to see it coming from a mile away (quite literally), and can choose to adjust your course. This also works on problems that arise in your journey. The higher this DC is, the earlier you will be able to detect problems.

### Leadership

While you are leading, you and your allies get a multiplier to their mps equal to your Leadership multiplier.

EX: If your CHA is +3, then your Leadership multiplier is x1.5, which means you multiply your and your allies’ mps times 1.5, which means you can travel farther.

## Leading

There is no one leader in the group. Each deer is good at different aspects of leading, so they switch out on a regular basis. While you are leading, you:

-   Decide which way to go
-   Decide how fast to go
-   Decide what method to travel by (see Travel Methods)
-   Navigate to your destination (Navigation)
-   Look ahead for any trouble (Encounter DC)
-   Give your team a morale boost (Leadership)
-   Hold the map, and give it commands
-   Decide whether to take a short rest

### Navigating

While leading, you decide which way to go to get to your destination. To navigate:

1.  Declare where you are
2.  Declare the method of travel you plan to take
3.  Declare the route you plan to take
4.  Declare how fast you plan to go
5.  Roll for Navigation (1d20 + Intelligence)

From here, the DM will describe what happens. Most likely, you will move along your route a number of miles equal to your Navigation Distance. Or there might be an encounter.

Then you and your team calculate how much stamina they’ve used. (see Stamina Usage)

### Pace Setting

While leading, you can decide how fast the herd goes. Going at normal speed has no effect on your mps. Going twice your speed halves your mps, and going half your speed doubles your mps.

## Stamina Usage

When you finish navigating to a waypoint, it’s time for you and your team to calculate how many stamina points you’ve used.

First, calculate your mps. Take your base mps and multiply it by all applicable entries in the following chart:

| **Condition**         | **Multiplier** |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Normal                | 1              |
| Difficult Terrain     | 0.5            |
| Uphill                | 0.8            |
| Downhill              | 1.2            |
| Ground Travel         | 1              |
| Air Travel            | 1.25           |
| Water Travel (Swim)   | 0.3            |
| Water Travel (Boat)   | 0              |
| Comfy Capacity        | 1              |
| Double Comfy Capacity | 0.5            |
| Half Comfy Capacity   | 1              |
| Average Speed         | 1              |
| +1 mph (Ground)       | 0.8            |
| +1 mph (Air)          | 0.9            |
| Front (Air)           | 0.8            |
| Back (Ground)         | 0.7            |
| No Wind               | 1              |
| Tail Wind             | 2              |
| Head Wind             | 0.5            |
| Perpendicular Wind    | 0.95           |

Now you have your net mps.

Second, take your net mps, and do the calculation:

Stamina used = (1 / mps) \* miles

Then reduce your current stamina by that amount. This might make your stamina a fractional value.

## Travel Methods

You travel a lot in this module. While traveling, you spend stamina for each mile you travel. You can choose to travel on foot, by flying, or by swimming or boat. Each of these methods have varying difficulty levels when encountering common problems in your journey.

| **Method** | **Terrain** | **Encounters** | **Wind** | **Cold** |
|------------|-------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| Footing    | Moderate    | Hard           | Easy     | Moderate |
| Flying     | Easy        | Easy           | Hard     | Hard     |
| Swimming   | Hard        | Easy           | Easy     | Hard     |
| Boating    | Easy        | Easy           | Easy     | Easy     |

### Footing

While on foot, you have to deal with difficult terrain and encounters with monsters are more common. However, you are immune to the wind effects of the blizzard.

### Flying

While flying, you have less chance of encountering enemies, and can get to the destination quicker and without worrying about terrain, but you are very susceptible to getting blown around by the wind. You might also get lost due to the lack of landmarks.

### Swimming

While swimming, you are less likely to encounter enemies and you don’t get blown around by the wind. If you stay near the shore, you also don’t get pushed around by the waves enough to matter. However, swimming is very slow, and you can get cold easily.

### Boating

While taking a boat, you can rest. However, you have to pay the toll each time to get on a boat. It’s also faster than swimming, though not as fast as going by foot or by flight.

# New Stuff (Part 2)

This is homebrew content pulled from other sources. Unless otherwise stated, it is from DM’s Secret Weapon, Dec 2023 issue (\#24).

## Spells

### Charge

1st-level Abjuration

1 action – Self – V S – Concentration – 1 minute

You fortify yourself with magic, building power in preparation for an explosive burst. When you cast this spell, and at the start of each of your turns, you gain 1d4 Temporary Hit Points.

When you cast a levelled spell using an action, you can choose to stop concentrating on this spell. If you do, treat that spell as if it were cast at one level higher than the level of the spell slot you expended to cast it.

### Icicle Lancer

2nd-level Evocation

1 action – 30ft range – V S M (a snowflake preserved in amber) – Instantaneous

Roll 1d4. You conjure a number of icicles equal to the result on the die, which you can hurl at targets you can see within 30 feet. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack roll for each icicle. On a hit, the icicle deals 2d4 cold damage.

*At Higher levels*. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 3rd-or-4th level, the size of the die you roll to determine how many icicles you conjure and the damage dice of each icicle increase to a d6. These dice increase to a d8 if you cast it with a 5th-or-6th level spell slot, a d10 if you cast it with a 7th-8th level spell slot, and a d12 if you cast it with a 9th level spell slot.

### Trace

4th-level Abjuration

1 reaction – 60ft range – V S – Instantaneous

When you see a creature within 60ft cast a spell, you may cast Trace as a reaction.

You attempt to trace the somatic and verbal components of a spell you can see being cast. If that spell is of a level lower than the slot level you used to cast this spell, and does not require Material components with a monetary value (e.g. a gem worth at least 50 gp), you successfully trace it, and you can cast that spell using this reaction without expending a further spell slot or requiring material components. Your casting of the spell happens immediately after the initial spellcaster casts it. If the spellcaster is casting a spell level equal to or higher than the slot level you used to cast this spell, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, you successfully trace the spell.
