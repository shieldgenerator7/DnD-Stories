# Winter Storm Delivery

D&D 5e Adventure

TO ALL PLAYERS: Please read the Premise and the Rules! This is very important!

## Premise

You play as deer pulling a delivery sled to a peninsula about to be frozen over by a blizzard. The cargo you carry will ensure the people of the frozen land can survive the winter storm. How will you survive the blizzard and make all the deliveries?

## Info

This adventure will focus more on exploration and resource management, with some combat and roleplaying. Each player will have a new resource: Stamina. This is used to determine how far you can travel in a day. Each of the 6 core attributes will have bonus effects that influence your stamina and how much you use, and this will effect your build decisions.

## Tracked Stats

The following will be tracked in this adventure:

-   Time
-   Distance traveled
-   Stamina

# Rules

This module is going to be a lot about exploration, route planning, and resource management. Your character has the following new resource: Stamina.

## Short Rest

A short rest is 12 minutes, during which you can eat 1 reindeer ration. A reindeer ration restores 25% of your max stamina.

## Stamina

Stamina is how far you can travel in a long rest. Under normal conditions, you spend 1 stamina to travel 1 mile at normal pace. Thus that means you can normally go 1 mile per 1 stamina (mps). If you want to conserve your stamina, you want a higher mps.

How much stamina you use per mile changes based on

Your mps is lower when you travel:

-   Faster than your comfy speed
-   Across difficult terrain
-   Uphill
-   Into a head wind
-   With more weight than your comfy carry capacity
-   In the front while flying
-   In the back while walking
-   By swimming

Your mps is higher when you travel:

-   Slower than your comfy speed
-   Across easy terrain
-   Downhill
-   Out of a tail wind
-   With less weight than your comfy carry capacity
-   In the back while flying
-   In the front while walking
-   By boat

Managing your stamina is very important. It’s the resource that lets you pull the sleigh. If you run out of stamina, you are no longer able to contribute to pulling the sleigh until you regain it.

## Attribute Effects on Stamina

Your attribute scores effect your stamina:

-   STR – Increases your carrying capacity
-   DEX – Increases your mps
-   CON – Increases your max stamina
-   INT – Increases the distance you can navigate\*
-   WIS – Increases the chance you will see upcoming danger\*
-   CHA – Increases the morale boost you provide for your team\*

\*only applicable while you’re the leader

### Stat Formulas

Mark these stats on your character sheet:

-   Carrying capacity (lbs) = 100 \* STR + 300
-   Miles Per Stamina (MPS) = 3 + DEX
-   Stamina\* = 50 \* CON + 50
-   Navigation (mi) = 5 \* INT + 10
-   Encounter DC = 8 + PB + WIS
-   Leadership = 0.25 \* CHA + 0.75

\* Refreshes on a long rest

### Carrying Capacity

Your mps scales inversely with the weight you’re carrying. While carrying a load that weighs as much as your carrying capacity, your mps is normal. While carrying a load that’s twice your carrying capacity, your mps is halved. While carrying a load that’s half your carrying capacity or less, your mps is increased by your DEX.

### Miles Per Stamina

For 1 point of stamina, you can travel this many miles.

### Max Stamina

This is the maximum amount of stamina you can have. A long rest gives you back full stamina.

### Navigation

While you are leading, you navigate. This is how far ahead you can navigate per navigation check. After you travel this far, you will have to roll another navigation check.

### Encounter DC

While you are leading, the DM has to beat this Encounter DC for you to get ambushed. If the DM fails this check, there might still be an encounter, but you will be able to see it coming from a mile away (quite literally), and can choose to adjust your course. This also works on problems that arise in your journey. The higher this DC is, the earlier you will be able to detect problems.

### Leadership

While you are leading, you and your allies get a multiplier to their mps equal to your Leadership multiplier.

EX: If your CHA is 3, then your Leadership multiplier is x1.5, which means you multiply your and your allies’ mps times 1.5, which means you can travel farther.

## Leading

There is no one leader in the group. Each deer is good at different aspects of leading, so they switch out on a regular basis. While you are leading, you:

-   Decide which way to go
-   Navigate to your destination (Navigation)
-   Look ahead for any trouble (Encounter DC)
-   Give your team a morale boost (Leadership)
-   Hold the map, and give it commands
-   Set the pace
-   Decide whether to take a short rest

### Pace Setting

While leading, you can decide how fast the herd goes. Going at normal speed has no effect on your mps. Going twice your speed halves your mps, and going half your speed doubles your mps.

## Travel

You travel a lot in this module. While traveling, you spend stamina for each mile you travel. You can choose to travel on foot, by flying, or by swimming or boat.

### Footing

While on foot, you have to deal with difficult terrain and encounters with monsters are more common. However, you are immune to the wind effects of the blizzard.

### Flying

While flying, you have less chance of encountering enemies, and can get to the destination quicker and without worrying about terrain, but you are very susceptible to getting blown around by the wind. You might also get lost due to the lack of landmarks.

### Swimming

While swimming, you are less likely to encounter enemies and you don’t get blown around by the wind. If you stay near the shore, you also don’t get pushed around by the waves enough to matter. However, swimming is very slow, and you can get cold easily.

### Boating

While taking a boat, you can rest. However, you have to pay the toll each time to get on a boat. It’s also faster than swimming, though not as fast as going by foot or by flight.
