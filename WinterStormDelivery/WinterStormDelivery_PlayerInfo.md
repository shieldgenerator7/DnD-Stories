# Winter Storm Delivery

D&D 5e Adventure

## Premise

You play as deer pulling a delivery sled to a peninsula about to be frozen over by a blizzard. The cargo you carry will ensure the people of the frozen land can survive the winter storm. How will you survive the blizzard and make all the deliveries?

## Info

This adventure will focus more on exploration and resource management, with some combat and roleplaying. Each player will have a new resource: Stamina. This is used to determine how far you can travel in a day. Each of the 6 core attributes will have bonus effects that influence your stamina and how much you use, and this will effect your build decisions.

Material components of spells will be tracked in this adventure.

## Setting

This adventure takes place within a year after Kraken Raid, on a peninsula not yet explored in the Minotaur’s Maze universe. The season is winter and a huge blizzard is coming to the land.

# Rules

This module is going to be a lot about exploration, route planning, and resource management. Your character has the following new stat:

-   Stamina (see Stamina)

**Short Rest**

A short rest is 12 minutes, during which you can eat 1 ration. A ration restores 25% of your stamina.

**Stamina**

Stamina is how far you can travel in a long rest. Under normal conditions, you spend 1 stamina to travel 1 mile at normal pace.

How much stamina you use per mile changes based on

-   How fast you’re moving
-   How difficult the terrain is
-   Hills
-   Wind
-   How much weight you’re carrying
-   Whether you’re in the front of the group or the back

**Travel**

You travel a lot in this module. While traveling, you spend stamina for each mile you travel. You can choose to travel on foot, by flying, or by swimming or boat.

While on foot, you have to deal with difficult terrain and encounters with monsters are more common. However, you are immune to the wind effects of the blizzard.

While flying, you have less chance of encountering enemies, and can get to the destination quicker and without worrying about terrain, but you are very susceptible to getting blown around by the wind. You might also get lost due to the lack of landmarks.

While swimming, you are less likely to encounter enemies and you don’t get blown around by the wind. If you stay near the shore, you also don’t get pushed around by the waves enough to matter. However, swimming is very slow, and you can get cold easily.

While taking a boat, you can rest. However, you have to pay the toll each time to get on a boat. It’s also faster than swimming, though not as fast as going by foot or by flight.

**Manifest**

This is the manifest log of the items in the sleigh and where they need to be delivered to.

The jingle bell has a max capacity of 1 item. Its weight doesn’t change when you put an item inside it. Otherwise, it works like a Bag of Holding.
