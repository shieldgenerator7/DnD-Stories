# Towns

This is a list of towns in the Scheninsel Peninsula that you will need to deliver to.

The map is fairly big, about 600 miles from Brecke to the edge of Otto’s Claim.

## Brecke

This is the town you start at. It is the major town where the peninsula meets the mainland. Very well populated, very well supplied. Great place to stock up on supplies.

## Schneeberg

The town located in the mountains right by the ravine. Populated by a few hundred people who don’t like crowds.

## Inseldorf

Island town. It’s far enough south that it suffers no ill effects from the winter storms. Very popular vacation destination, with lots of beaches.

## Ausgelddorf

Mining town that relies completely on supplies from other towns. Trades in gold and other ores that they mine from the ice caves.

## Wolf Run

Tree farming village smack dab in the center of wolf country. The town has banned wolf hunting in the areas immediately around the town and its tree farms.

## Ottostadt

A strange, fully-built city with only a few hundred people. Half the city has been abandoned, and the other half barely survives.

## Otto Falls

A suburb of Ottostadt, built around the scenic location where water falls in the Mouth of Klaus. A major tourist attraction in the summer, but a ghost town in winter.

## Espen

A prosperous town along the northern river. It has a resource mine and a small indoor farming facility.

## Hinweis Outpost

A research station monitoring environmental changes. Run by a few dozen people. Not much has been heard from them lately.

# Magic Items

These are the magic items your party has.

## Magic Reindeer Collar

While wearing this collar, you gain the following benefits:

-   Flight Speed of 90ft
-   Telekinetic feat
-   If you attempt to walk on two feet, you must succeed on a DC20 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

## Scheninsel Peninsula Map

A magic map of the peninsula that automatically updates when you see changes to the roads. It also always shows you where you are on the map.

# Rules

This module is going to be a lot about exploration, route planning, and resource management. Your character has the following new stat:

-   Stamina (see Stamina)

## Short Rest

A short rest is 12 minutes, during which you can eat 1 ration. A ration restores 25% of your stamina.

# Stamina

Stamina is how far you can travel in a long rest. Under normal conditions, you spend 1 stamina to travel 1 mile at normal pace.

How much stamina you use per mile changes based on

-   How fast you’re moving
-   How difficult the terrain is
-   Hills
-   Wind
-   How much weight you’re carrying
-   Whether you’re in the front of the group or the back

# Travel

You travel a lot in this module. While traveling, you spend stamina for each mile you travel. You can choose to travel on foot, by flying, or by swimming or boat.

While on foot, you have to deal with difficult terrain and encounters with monsters are more common. However, you are immune to the wind effects of the blizzard.

While flying, you have less chance of encountering enemies, and can get to the destination quicker and without worrying about terrain, but you are very susceptible to getting blown around by the wind. You might also get lost due to the lack of landmarks.

While swimming, you are less likely to encounter enemies and you don’t get blown around by the wind. If you stay near the shore, you also don’t get pushed around by the waves enough to matter. However, swimming is very slow, and you can get cold easily.

While taking a boat, you can rest. However, you have to pay the toll each time to get on a boat. It’s also faster than swimming, though not as fast as going by foot or by flight.

# Manifest

This is the manifest log of the items in the sleigh and where they need to be delivered to.

# Enemies

There’s lots of hazards in the Schneninsel Peninsula. Most of them are known to the locals.

## Snowmen

Evil snowmen that throw snowballs. They are usually found in the mountains, where they delight in knocking victims off ledges.

## Bears

Standard polar bears. Always hungry and willing to fight.

## Wolves

Standard wolf packs. They are dangerous when together. They are legally protected in some areas.

## Seagulls

These birds steal anything they can get, and can be very persistent too.

## Moose

The artic giant deer. Solitary animals that can wreck things up all by themselves.

## Rudolph

Folk tales tell of a reindeer corrupted by evil, haunting the forests of the Schneninsula Peninsula. No verified accounts have ever been recorded, but locals swear it’s real.

## Otto’s Dismay

They say Ottostadt isn’t a ghost town for no reason. And this ghastly figure, they say, is the reason. The locals won’t let anyone get in its “hunting zone” to verify it, for “safety reasons”. Some think it’s real, others think it’s a hoax intended to draw tourist attention.
