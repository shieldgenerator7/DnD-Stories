======


sonata runs around the ship, happy she can walk without falling down


the party travels on ship for a few days

every night they have a shared dream in the dreamscape


one day, sonata asks tint about painting
tint doesn't have enough supplies
sonata pulls him to dream scape
they appear in a maze full of art supplies
with things in a crazy version
a three-headed brush
a waterfall ful of multiple colors of paints
an entire blank wall as a canvas


then one day they come across another ship
they get closer


clike yells to the other ship
trent: "you all seem new here and youve entered my territory. what are you doing here?"
clike "were on a mission to dilver some goods to a city"'
trent "who sent you that mission"
clike "some kenku"
trent "ofc its that kenku, hes been sending ppl to deliver stuff to my territory for some time. so annoying. and youre just his latest pawn in his scheme correct?"
clike "weve been paid quite handsomely"
trent "your loot is quite pretty.i would like to take it off your hands"
clike tells wayne to go talk to trent
trent "so bc this will be our last meeting, and i will be taking your loot, my name is pirate captain aurix"
