clike and sonata talk
sonata makes clike giant wings "lighter" (light spell)

sonata says her alignment is "sweet and delightful" according to other townspeople
clike asks if shes follows rules
sonata lets out that she does follow rules, if she knows them
some rules:
-dont pee in the certain place (implied to be public drinking water source)
-dont stand in doorways
-picking your nose is bad

the light on clike's wings turn red



the party expolores the cold dark lonely citadel in the middle of a space, very dream scapy, but nightmare

cultist: "even if i knew, i would not tell you"

WT and clike try to intimidate the cultist, but it fails

sonata asks why they work for the dragon, its bc "shes a god"

WT tries to bargain with the cultist, to lessen his punishment, cultist refuses

WT says "were going to find out what happens when someone dies in here"



=== combat begins ===

sonata walks away, faerie fires the other three
they all failed
sonata dreamers eye:
"cultist: 9hp, 35ft away"
"WT: 36hp, 20ft away"

WT shortswords the cultist, knocks him out


=== combat ends ===


sonata wants to heal him, but she doesn't know his name

WT searches his body, finds 24 gold

sonata throws a coin with her censer, for fun

sonata lore: she wasn't allowed in the "big house" in her town, which was a mansion



party gets to mansion, sonata surprised about going into mansion, says its the "big house", party surprised she doesn't know, she describes mansion, but they tell her thats a shack
