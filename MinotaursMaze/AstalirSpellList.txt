=== Deer Mold Earth ===

Deer Mold Earth
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You compress the 5ft cube into the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to it. You cause an outcropping of the same size to jut out of the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to the same stone, up to 10ft away. This movement happens simultaneously and doesn’t have enough force to cause bludgeoning damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes 85ft from you or further, it reverts. Each change automatically reverts 1 hour after it was made.



=== Deer Shape Water ===

Deer Shape Water
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to a distance of 10ft, where the water stays in place. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
- You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction.
- You change the water’s color and/or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout.
- You freeze the water. If the water is still frozen when this effect ends, it unfreezes.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes 85ft from you or further, it reverts. Each change automatically reverts 1 hour after it was made.



=== Deer Silent Image ===

Deer Silent Image
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: V S M
a bit of fleece
Duration: Concentration, 1 hour

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot you can see within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

On your turn, you can animate it as you direct and move the image to any spot. If the image becomes more than 85ft away from you, it disappears.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. A creature gets advantage on this check if they notice the image interacting unnaturally with its surroundings. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.



=== Deer Disguise Self ===

Deer Disguise Self (At Will)
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V S
Duration: 1 hour

Granted by Hat of Disguise, which makes this spell consume no spell slots and be castable as a free action once per turn.

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. You can animate it as you direct, and can add and remove accessories.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. A creature gets advantage on this check if they notice your disguise interacting unnaturally with its surroundings. If a creature discerns you are disguised, the creature can see through the disguise.



=== Deer Illusory Script ===

Deer Illusory Script
Illusion 1 (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a surface on parchment, paper, rock, skin, fabric, water, or other material that you can see within range and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration. The illusion appears as up to 15 characters that appear one by one in the order and position you designate.

The writing appears normal, written in any handwriting you have seen, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. The writing can be written in any language, though the language must be one you can speak or write. The writing can be any color and opacity, and can be any size as long as the 15 characters can all fit together in a 5ft square. If you wish, you may make the characters glow, emitting dim light in a 5ft radius.

If the writing becomes more than 90ft away from you, it disappears.
If you ritual cast it, there is no character limit.



=== Comprehend Languages ===

Comprehend Languages
Divination 1 (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V S M
a pinch of soot and salt
Duration: 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.



=== Color Spray ===

Color Spray
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Components: V S M
Duration: 1 round

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can’t see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for the creature to be affected.
At Higher LevelsWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.
