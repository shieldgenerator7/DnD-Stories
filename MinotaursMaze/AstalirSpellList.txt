=== Deer Mold Earth ===

Deer Mold Earth
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You compress the 5ft cube into the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to it. You cause an outcropping of the same size to jut out of the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to the same stone, up to 10ft away. This movement happens simultaneously and doesn’t have enough force to cause bludgeoning damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes 85ft from you or further, it reverts. Each change automatically reverts 1 hour after it was made.



=== Deer Shape Water ===

Deer Shape Water
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to a distance of 10ft, where the water stays in place. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
- You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction.
- You change the water’s color and/or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout.
- You freeze the water. If the water is still frozen when this effect ends, it unfreezes.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes 85ft from you or further, it reverts. Each change automatically reverts 1 hour after it was made.



=== Deer Silent Image ===

Deer Silent Image
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: V S M
a bit of fleece
Duration: Concentration, 1 hour

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot you can see within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

On your turn, you can animate it as you direct and move the image to any spot. If the image becomes more than 85ft away from you, it disappears.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. A creature gets advantage on this check if they notice the image interacting unnaturally with its surroundings. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.



=== Disguise Self ===

Disguise Self (At Will)
Illusion 1
Casting Time:1 action
Range: Self
Components: V S
Duration: 1 hour

Granted by Hat of Disguise

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
