Deer Mold Earth
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You compress the 5ft cube into the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to it. You cause an outcropping of the same size to jut out of the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to the same stone, up to 10ft away. This movement happens simultaneously and doesn’t have enough force to cause bludgeoning damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes more than 90ft from you, it reverts. Each change automatically reverts 1 hour after it was made.



=== Deer Shape Water ===

Deer Shape Water
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to a distance of 10ft, where the water stays in place. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
- You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction.
- You change the water’s color and/or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout.
- You freeze the water. If the water is still frozen when this effect ends, it unfreezes. If there is a creature in the water, they must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be stuck in the ice. A creature stuck in the ice may use their action to make a Strength ability check, and on a success, break free of the ice.



=== Deer Plant Whip ===

Deer Plant Whip
Transmutation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour

You cause a plant within range to rapidly grow out at a creature within 10ft of it. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the plant wraps around the creature.
While wrapped, if the creature attempts to move outside the plant's 10ft pull radius, the creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, the creature breaks free of the plant. On a failed save, the creature is pulled to the plant's location and becomes restrained until its next turn.

You can dismiss this effect as an action. If the plant's base becomes more than 90ft from you, it reverts. This effect automatically ends after 1 hour.

At Higher Levels. The plant's initial grow range increases by 10 when you reach 5th level (20), 11th level (30), and 17th level (40).



=== Deer Silent Image ===

Deer Silent Image
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: V S M
a bit of fleece
Duration: Concentration, 1 hour

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot you can see within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

On your turn, you can animate it as you direct and move the image to any spot as a free action. As an action, you can alter the illusion in any way you want.

Physical interaction with the image reveals that it is an illusion. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. A creature gets advantage on this check if they notice the image interacting unnaturally with its surroundings. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.



=== Deer Disguise Self ===

Deer Disguise Self (At Will)
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V S
Duration: 1 hour

Granted by Hat of Disguise, which makes this spell consume no spell slots.

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. You can animate it as you direct, and can add and remove accessories.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. A creature gets advantage on this check if they notice your disguise interacting unnaturally with its surroundings. If a creature discerns you are disguised, the creature can see through the disguise.



=== Deer Alter Self ===

Deer Alter Self
Transmutation 2
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. As an action, you can change one active effect into a different effect.

- Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills, and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

- Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also don’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

- Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

- Change Material. Your skin turns to stone, wood, iron, or other material of your choice. You may use this to become petrified or unpetrified. You can not move the parts of your body that are not made of flexible material.



=== Deer Illusory Script ===

Deer Illusory Script
Illusion Cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a surface on parchment, paper, rock, skin, fabric, water, or other material that you can see within range and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration. The illusion appears as up to 15 characters that appear one by one in the order and position you designate.


You can dismiss the writing as an action. If the writing becomes more than 90ft away from you, it disappears.
The writing appears normal, written in any handwriting you have seen, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. The writing can be written in any language, though the language must be one you can write. The writing can be any color and opacity, and can be any size as long as the 15 characters can all fit together in a 5ft square. If you wish, you may make the characters glow, emitting dim light in a 5ft radius.



=== Comprehend Languages ===

Comprehend Languages
Divination 1 (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V S M
a pinch of soot and salt
Duration: 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.



=== Deer Color Sphere ===

Deer Color Sphere
Illusion 1
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Target: A point within range
Components: V S
Duration: 1 hour

A dazzling 5ft-radius sphere of flashing, colored light appears at a point within range that you have line of sight to. It emits bright light out to a radius of 90ft.

A creature within 90ft that can see the sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, or be blinded until its next turn.

A creature within the sphere's 5ft radius that can see automatically counts as being able to see the sphere, and has disadvantage on the save.

You may dismiss the sphere as an action. If it becomes more than 90ft away from you, it disappears.
You may move the sphere 20ft as a bonus action, if the sphere is within your casting range.

=== Deer Phantasmal Force ===

Deer Phantasmal Force
Illusion 2
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Target: A point within range
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour

At a point in range that you can see, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

When a creature first perceives the phantasm, it perceives the phantasm as real.

A creature can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the creature realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a creature perceives the phantasm as real, the creature can take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack a target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn creatures within it. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to affected creatures that are within in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The creature perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion. This spell does no damage to undead or constructs.

If the phantasm becomes more than 90ft from you, it disappears. You can dismiss the phantasm as an action.



=== Deer Invisibility ===

Deer Invisibility
Illusion 2
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30ft
Target: A creature or object in range
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour

A creature or object you can see in range becomes invisible until the spell ends. The target must be able to fit into a 10ft cube.

If the target is a creature, anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends if the target deals damage or takes damage.

If the target is an object, anything inside, on top of, or attached to the target is also invisible as long as it stays inside, on top of, or attached to the target.

If a creature touches the target, it may use an action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a success, it can see the target as if the target wasn't invisible.

If the target becomes more than 90ft from you, the spell ends. You can dismiss this spell as an action.
