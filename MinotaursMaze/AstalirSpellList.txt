Deer Mold Earth
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5ft cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You compress the 5ft cube into the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to it. You cause an outcropping of the same size to jut out of the ground, wall, or ceiling attached to the same stone, up to 10ft away. This movement happens simultaneously and doesnâ€™t have enough force to cause bludgeoning damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes 85ft from you or further, it reverts. Each change automatically reverts 1 hour after it was made.
