Mold Earth
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S
Duration: 1 hour

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You move the 5-foot cube up to 10 feet away. This movement doesnâ€™t have enough force to cause damage. This change lasts for 1 hour.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

You can dismiss one change as an action. If a change becomes 85ft from you or further, it reverts.
