enon thoughts on jodi:

after session1, jodi is not very trsuting of others now
becoems a judge, becoems a lawyer to punish those who do wrong
not trusting of outsiders


firbogls live in communities



firbolgs can talk to animals, so animals understand, but firbolgs cannt naturally understand animals


firbolg will abandon music to go to fighting to defend his home

firbolgs protect home by making it inconvenient for travelers to come to his house

jodi tries to reveal the truth, reveal scammers, punsih those who are untruthful
reporter, lawyer, investigator

to jodi, the truth is the utmost importance

his perception on world has changed, he doesnt know if everybody is telling the truth
