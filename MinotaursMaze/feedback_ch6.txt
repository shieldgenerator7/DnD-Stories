praise: mr pigersus

new gra is a symbol of toxic psitivty?

gra is so entranced with love of astalir, like a pet,

astalir shifts gras world view

gra is reconciling the factthat hes not hte way he wants to be
astalir shows its ok to be a little bit natural and a littel goofy and not like everyone else

good emotional honesty: gra getting freaked out by astalir's almost death

===========

advice: mr pigersus
author has to mix why with the plot, how it unfolds, what are the consequences. analsysi of what you believe, how you believe things should be, what is stopping things from being how they should be, and deliver it in an engagin way

emotional honesty
add imperfections to dialogue, character speaking quirks, flawed ways of speaking, acting, thinking

"dont touch, this is for dinner tonight": should he have to give reason to not touch it? 

"he didnt hold anything, how did he get there before me?": make it more subconscious before thinking about it consciously
weird feeling first

one thing: logistics. how does a paper fall? pushed by wind, off a windowsill, thrown?

emotional honesty needs improvement

bad emotional honesty: hunted deer's death

why would your character want to do whatever they want to?

use info the characters have, not the info you have

add details that are never said explicitly, for readers who really like it

overthinking: 

youretoo smart, and you skip steps, making things confusing
-> BE PATIENT
be patient with yourself, be patient with your story, how you feel about your story, and how ppl react tot the story
take you time, go to basics, 

make set of guidelines for writing, to remind yourself of what to look out for

show the steps emotionally honestly. reader has to udnerstand why they would act like that

==========

advice: zen
writing is on the nose

describe things in less obvious ways

needs a emotional core, and how they evolve from the events in the story

never mention background things, give hints to it
ex: cheating couple, code word: "going to denver"

break things down step by step. go from tell -> show

you need the emotional meaning of the characters

focus around the emotional experience of the character

make events 

art is to share emotional experiences
words alone are not enough to describe a feeling

look for emotional dishonetsy when ppl play their characters

overanalysis for logistics and emotional honesty



==========

on the nose, dialogue or descriptions?

comments: Fancy
feels like a dnd novel

feels like the arc starts and resolves in the same chapter

all sentences are compound, try to simplify 

word choice is a little off

make past tense consistent

scenes to play out: party leaving the kobolds behind

goodlength for a chapter, but couldve been one or two more scenes

vary sentence structue

reread what you say aloud
