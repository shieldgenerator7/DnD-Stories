# The Minotaur’s Maze

This is a novelization of a D&D campaign, told more or less from the perspective of my character, Astalir.

Chapter 0 – Prologue

[scene: backstory]

# Chapter 1 – Good Hunting

A robot, a bugbear, and a dragonborn walk into a bar.

The bartender, a bearded dwarf, cleans a glass. “What can I get for you, sir?”

The dragonborn leans his staff against the counter. “Get me a sweet tea.”

The dwarf cusses in dwarfish as he fills a cup. “Good day to you. A silver.”

The dragonborn grumbles and plinks down a gold piece.

“He doesn’t have any silver.” The robot laughs under his breath to the bugbear.

The dragonborn looks his way. “Excuse me?”

“Thanks for the tip.” The dwarf pockets the gold.

“No, I need change.” The dragonborn clarifies.

“And he’s strapped for cash.” The bugbear whispers to the robot.

“What was that?”

The robot and bugbear stop talking.

The bugbear turns to the dwarf. “I’ll have a water.”

“1 copper.” The dwarf produces a glass of water.

The bugbear searches through his coin purse. He grumbles as he hands the dwarf a gold piece.

The dragonborn chuckles. “Who doesn’t have a copper piece?”

“You want change?”

“Yes, please.” The bugbear grumbled.

“And is strapped for cash?” The dragonborn chuckles as he takes a sip of his sweet tea.

“Ignore him.” The robot squinted at the dragonborn. “I’ll have a cup of vinegar.”

“3 copper.”

The robot slides 3 copper from the bugbear’s pile over the counter.

The bugbear grumbles but continues pocketing the change.

The dwarf serves the drinks and the three sip up.

The bugbear orders a steak. The robot takes it without asking.

“Hey!” The bugbear growls. He bites the robot’s hand off. “My steak.” He chews and lets the robot’s hand sloppily fall out of his mouth.

The robot picks up his hand, reattaches it, and finds there’s meat all over it. “Mm! Steak!” The robot licks the meat off his hand.

The robot tries to steal more steak, but the bugbear slaps him away, and accidentally also hits the dragonborn.

“Hey!” The dragonborn breathes fire onto the bugbear, singing his head hair.

“How about I kill him right now?” The robot draws a dagger.

The bugbear growls.

“Enough! No brawling, no shanking, and absolutely NO fire breathing in my tavern!” The dwarf breaks up the fight.

Everyone calms down.

“Sorry, I’m not looking for trouble.” The dragonborn admits. “I’m just looking for a quest.”

“Well do I got a job for you ruffians.” The dwarf pulls out a map. “I need you to go to this location and find someone named Silvia. I’ll pay you 300gp.”

“300 gold? Sure, I’ll do it.”

“We’ll join you.” The robot volunteers.

“No, thank you.”

“You’ll need the help.” The dwarf agrees. “You might need more adventurers.”

“Ok, fine.” The dragonborn walks away with the map.

“Hold on! That map costs 3 silver!” The dwarf yells.

The dragonborn pays for it. As the robot and bugbear follow him out, a mysterious figure sits in a corner watching them.

They walk to a church of Almainter, the God of Sun and Law. As they get there, the church lets out. The congregation pours out and the cleric appears to close the doors.

This cleric is also a dragonborn, and has glorious green scales.

The dragonborn walks up to him and slaps him.

The cleric dodges and shouts, “Hey! That’s attempted assault! By the law, you are hereby banned from this church!”

The dragonborn pulls his hand back. “Sorry. I’m looking for Silvia. Is she here?”

“Who’s asking?”

The party tells him about the dwarf’s quest and they go back to the tavern. As they leave the church, a peasant appears along the wall scrubbing the pure white walls.

Back at the tavern, the cleric asks the dwarf about this quest. The dwarf explains it, and the cleric writes up a contract. After it’s made official, the dwarf throws the contract into the bag of 300 gold. It’s made clear that the 300 gold is for the whole party, and not for each individual member.

They leave the tavern. As they leave, an old man in tattered robes holds out a tin cup. “Alms for the poor?”

“Look at this poor old man.” The robot remarks.

“Here, have this.” The bugbear throws a bone with meat on it into the cup.

“Thank you, young man.” The old man takes the bone and starts chewing. “Very crunchy.”

“You better not be causing any kind of disturbance out here.” The cleric scolds. “Or I’ll arrest you for loitering.”

“Well how about he joins the party?” The bugbear suggests. “Then he won’t be loitering.”

“Are you good at adventuring, old man?” The robot leans over.

“Do I look like I am?” The old man shows his arm. It’s all skin and bones.

“No.”

The old man holds out a hand. “Help me up?”

“Ok, I see. You are not fit for adventuring.”

“Maybe he has some wise words of wisdom?” The bugbear asks. “What’s your wisdom?”

“Don’t sniff your finger after you poop.”

“Good enough for me.” The bugbear picks him up. Some of the old man’s clothes clip through the bug bear’s fur, but no one notices.

“Oh, are you taking me home?”

“If you want.”

“He has a home?” The robot asks.

“Do you?”

“It’s over there.” The old man points.

The bugbear follows the old man’s pointers to behind the tavern. There’s two trees behind the tavern with a rope tied between them. A tarp hangs on the rope.

“Here you go.” The bugbear puts the old man in the tree.

“Thanks, young bear man.” The old man gnaws on the bone.

“Here, be dignified. Use this.” The robot hands the old man a dagger.

The old man cuts the bone into 4 pieces and hands the dagger back. “Thanks.”

“Ok, let’s get on with the quest.” The dragonborn pushes the party onward.

The party journeys out of town, following the map. The dragonborn leads them into a forest in the middle of the wilderness. They hear a handpan musical instrument playing next to a river. They approach the sound, and find a firbolg sitting on a rock.

The robot claps loudly. It sounds like pots and pans banging together. “Very lovely. Do you want to go on an adventure with us?”

“Oh hello.” The firbolg sets down his instrument. “I suppose I could go on an adventure. What kind?”

“Dungeoneering. We need to find someone.” The robot climbs on the bugbear’s back.

The firbolg shrugs. “I’m not sure.”

The bugbear pulls out a flute. “I really like your music. I also play an instrument.” The bugbear plays a tune.

Jodi applauds. “Very nice song. You all seem like very nice people. I think I will come along.”

“Ok, great. Let’s get on with the mission.” The dragonborn pounds his staff on the ground.

“By the way, I’m Jodi. I’m a firbolg.”

“New friend!” The bugbear picks up Jodi. “I’m Micro.”

The robot nods.

“What’s your names?” Jodi asks.

“Silber Posten.” The robot announces.

“Dralth.” The cleric states.

“I’m Trent.” The dragonborn looks at the map. “And I’m trying to use this map to see where we’re going.”

“What do we have here?” Silber the robot looks through his scope and spies a deer across the river.

The deer drinks water from the river under the shade of an oak tree. Its antlers are large and glorious.

“What a beauty you are.” Silber takes his rifle and aims it at the deer.

“Hold on, don’t kill it!” Jodi protests.

“Fine, I won’t.” Silber shoots the deer. The bullet hits its antler, breaking it off near the base. “I just wanted its horn anyway.”

“It’s called an ‘antler’.” Dralth the cleric corrected.

Jodi looked on, mouth agape.

Dralth comforted him. “It’s legal, see? It’s a buck. It’s buck hunting season.”

“I guess.” Jodi agreed.

“Now just to go across the river and collect my antler.” Silber points Micro the bugbear across the river.

But before their eyes, the unexpected happened. The deer’s missing antler magically floats up into the air and reattaches itself to the deer’s head. The deer sprints away. the damaged antler jostles in place as it runs.

Micro carries Silber across the river.

“What the?” Silber examines the place the deer was. “That was weird.”

Jodi breathes a sigh of relief as he watches the deer escape. “Ok, these people don’t *kill* wild animals, so they’re still good people.”

Trent and Jodi also cross the river, leaving Dralth alone by himself.

A random owlbear appears!

Trent runs back across the river to escape. He picks up a rock, tosses it in the air, and magically propels it through the air to the owlbear.

The owlbear dodges it, and turns its rage to Trent. It crosses the river as if it was nothing, and swings a claw at Trent.

Dralth acts fast. He shines a bright light on the owlbear, causing it to miss Trent.

The owlbear lunges forward with its teeth, taking a big chunk out of Trent’s body. Thankfully it misses the map.

Silber takes his rifle and aims it at the owlbear. BANG! A bullet gets lodged in the owlbear’s head. The owlbear survives. “Giddyup! I gotta be the one to kill him!” He prods Micro to run along the river towards the owlbear.

Micro the bugbear wields his polearm, which is a really long weapon. So long, in fact, that he can reach across the entire river and hit the owlbear. The owlbear turns to Micro just in time to see Micro scream and project an image of a spectral bear around him.

Dralth shines another light in the owlbear’s face. This one is a searing scorching ray of light. It fries the owlbear’s brain and it falls over dead.

Trent holds his gut. It bleeds profusely. “How am I going to complete this quest now?”

Out of nowhere, 2 brown bears appear behind Jodi.

Jodi speaks in a pleasant voice to the bears. “Hey, we’re all friends here. Go on about your day and we’ll go on about ours. Does that sound good?”

The bears calm down and walk away.

Jodi contemplates the situation. “Ok, they killed the owlbear mercilessly, but it’s a monster. They are good people for taking it out before it hurts people. They’re good people. They let the brown bears go about—"

“Ooh! Aren’t you a beaut!” The robot takes his rifle and shoots one of the bears. It dies instantly. “Score!”

Jodi’s mouth falls agape. “Ok, maybe they’re hungry?”

“This bear is mine! Yogi Bear demands it!” Micro roars and charges at the other living bear. “No one else is allowed to attack it! I’m so blood thirsty!”

Micro thrusts his polearm straight into the bear’s side. The bear bleeds out and roars.

“You can’t tell me what to do!” Trent takes a moment to cast a spell, ignoring his wound. “Jim’s Magic Missile!” He shoots three glowing projectiles at the bear, pelting it in its side, but not doing much.

“You ruined my challenge!” Micro angrily declares.

The brown bear, enraged, attacks Micro and severely wounds him.

A fly wanders into Jodi’s agape mouth.

Micro shanks the bear dead. “I challenged the bear! You ruined my challenge!” Micro ran across the river towards Trent.

“Oh crap.” Trent runs away. “Magnify Gravity!” He casts it on the ground on Micro, but Micro shakes it off like it was nothing, even though he gets a scratch and Silber gets a scratch. “Oh crap!”

“You’re mine!” Silber takes his rifle and shoots Trent in the leg.

“Oh shit!” Trent falls face first into the mud.

Micro stalks closer to Trent.

“Hold on!” Dralth the cleric puts up a hand. “Killing him is illegal.”

Jodi takes a deep breath. “Good. The cleric will stop them from killing him, and he will get healed. They’re not all bad people.”

Silber pulls out a scroll from his bag. “He’s my target.”

Dralth reads over the scroll. It says that there’s a bounty on this dragonborn and that Silber is a licensed bounty hunter. “Mm. So it is legal. Carry on.” He hands back the scroll.

Jodi sweats.

Micro stabs Trent through the chest, pinning him to the ground.

Trent breathes heavily, trying to stay alive.

Silber hops off Micro and lands hard on Trent’s back. He takes his dagger and slices Trent’s dragon head clean off his shoulders. “Bounty acquired!” Silber presents his prize. He bags it.

Jodi almost faints. He goes invisible and runs away. “These are NOT good people! The cleric lets anything happen, the bugbear attacks anything that moves, and the robot is a MURDERER.” Jodi breathes rapidly out of control. “I can’t… I can’t take this…”

CRUNCH

A deer appears out of the woods. It leans down to take a bite of grass.

Jodi calms down. “Oh hello.”

The deer turns to him. It continues chewing. The antler jiggles weirdly as it does so. A crack is very visible near the base.

“Oh, you’re the deer the robot shot. Are you hurt?” Jodi crouched and approached the deer. “Come here, boy.”

The deer approached and knelt his head down. It sniffed Jodi’s hand.

“That’s it, come here.” Jodi holds the deer’s head. “Oh you poor boy. Here, let me help you with that.” Jodi rips a piece of his clothes and ties it up on the antler. “There you go.”

The antler was strapped in place. The deer backed up and moved its head all around. The antler stayed in place. The deer looked at him and smiled.

“I’m glad you like it.” Jodi breathed a happy sigh. “I’m glad you’re better.”

“Thank you so much!” The deer spoke.

“Ah!” Jodi jolted.

“I really appreciate it. I wouldn’t want to have to wait another season for them to grow back.”

“Oh, no worries.” Jodi regained his composure. “You talk?”

“Ah, yes, I am a Deerkin, a sentient deer species.”

“I’ve heard of you. I haven’t ever seen your kind before.”

“We… stay hidden. Most of the time.”

“Well it’s nice to see you.” Jodi hugged the deer. “Am I sure glad to see you. And see that you’re ok.” Jodi cried onto the deer’s shoulder.

“Is everything… ok?”

“It is now.” Jodi nodded. “Can I ask you a question?”

“Yes.”

“Are people all bad?”

The deer squinted and sighed. “I’ve found that people, on the whole, are good. But there’s always a hoof-ful of people that are so bad that they bring the average down.”

Jodi cried even harder.

“But they’re mostly good. Like you!” The deer nuzzles Jodi’s backside. “You bring the average way way up. So just, keep your chin up, yeah? Things will get better.”

“Thank you.” Jodi wiped some tears from his eyes. “I’m Jodi, by the way. I’m a firbolg.”

“I know what you are. And I am Astalir the Deer.”

“It’s nice to meet you Astalir.”

“You too, Jodi, you too.”

# Chapter 2 – The Minotaur’s Maze

Apparently at some point, the party captured Astalir and tied him up with a rope so he couldn’t escape. They traveled together to the dungeon. Astalir tried using his tricks to escape, but they found him every time. They tried talking to him, but all he would say was, “BLEAT!” He didn’t feel like he could trust them to know that he could talk. They all thought he was just a magical deer.

The party walks along until they find a traveling merchant. “Hello, fellow travelers!” The merchant greets them. “Care to test your luck?”

Sui, a dragonborn that recently joined the party, shrugged. “Why not?”

“Great!” The merchant rubbed his hands together excitedly. “I have many decks for you to choose from!”

“Did you just say the deck of many things?” Silber Posten asked.

“No, I said ‘many decks’. And those decks are: the magical deck, the weapon deck, the fancy deck, and last but not least: the random oddities deck.”

“Ooh what’s in the random oddities deck?” Sui asked.

“Draw a card and see.”

Sui takes a card. The card twists morphs in his hand into a mug of fresh hot coffee. The handle landed perfectly in his hand so he held it steadily. Sui breathed the smell in. “Coffeeeee…” He sighed, letting out a little bit of fire into the cup. He gulped it down. His eyes widened and stature rose. “Wow! I feel great!”

“Ah yes, the coffee cup of energizing. A most coveted oddity, for sure.” The merchant hands the deck of oddities to Silber.

“This looks like a good deck to draw from.” Silber draws a card. The card puffs into a cloud of air and surrounds Silber’s face. “What the…”

“The oddity of water breathing, truly a classic.” The merchant turns to Micro the bugbear.

“Me want hit things.” Micro grabs a card from the weapon deck. The card turns into a bomb with a laughing face drawn on it. “What do?”

The merchant cackles. “Let’s just say… it’s great for when your jokes don’t land.”

The merchant looks at Astalir for a brief second. Astalir takes the opportunity to take a card from the magical deck, which he happened to know was actually the deck of many things. The card he drew vanished and he with it.

The party gasped, trying to figure out where Astalir went.

The merchant shrugged. “He got teleported to the minotaur’s dungeon. He’ll be safe there until the minotaur comes to collect him.”

In the dungeon, Astalir sat in a cage. He looked around the dark room with his night vision. There was a chest on the other side of the room. He couldn’t reach it with his hooves because of the cage. The cage was made of iron and couldn’t be effected by Astalir’s reality warping abilities. At least not yet. He examined the lock. It was an ordinary lock that he could very easily pick.

Footsteps.

Astalir was now aware he wasn’t alone. Perhaps this cage was designed to keep him in, but it could also keep whatever is out there out. He could use it for protection.

He surmised that he was in the minotaur’s maze somewhere. The party would come eventually to raid the maze. He had hoped that the party could be the distraction he needed to go in undetected, but now he knew that they could not be trusted.

He shrugged. Might as well use the cage while he cast Comprehend Languages. He waited until the cast time was over to unlock the cage. He found a treasure chest in the room with him. It had a nameplate on it that simply read, “Sandwich”. He picked the lock and opened the chest. It was empty, save for a single sandwich.

As he picked it up, it suddenly started glowing blue. What kind of magic was this? Whatever it was, he’d have to take it back to someone that knew how to detect magic. He wasn’t about to bite into a magical sandwich without knowing what it did. He pocketed the sandwich and took it with him.

He explored the maze, taking note of all the booby traps. He marked a red X on the ground where all the booby traps were. The maze was also riddled with monsters of all kinds. Astalir easily outsmarted them with his illusions. While they were chasing fake deer, he was running around. He led a few of them into the booby traps they were supposed to be guarding. He snuck around a lot too, staying in the shadows when possible.

Finally he searched all the rooms and didn’t find any documents. All rooms except one. He found a secret passage that led into a lobby with other rooms branching out from it. He ventured in, sensing the presence of a powerful being. And the presence—or lack there of—of magic. An antimagic field. His illusions didn’t work inside. And the room had next to no cover. The being inside was a huge minotaur—the huge minotaur.

Astalir turned back and went back to the cave entrance. A group of skeletons followed him, and this time he couldn’t shake them. He ran all the way back to the cage and locked it. The skeletons left him alone.

Fine. As much as he distrusted the party, he would need them to go in and take the brunt of the hits for him if he was going to get to the documents. He was sure the documents were in the unexplored rooms just past the antimagic field.

He waited for hours, but finally, the party did come.

“Deer!” Micro the bugbear ran up to the cage and hugged it. “Don’t worry! I free you!” Micro squeezed the cage tight, but instead of freeing Astalir, he just decreased the amount of space he had inside.

“BLEEEAT!” Astalir cried, trying to get him to stop.

“Skeletons!” Sui exclaimed, getting into battle positions. “They’re mine! I challenge them!”

“Did I hear someone say challenge?” Micro dropped the cage and stood at the doorway to the room with the skeletons. “Sui, you may not leave until you have defeated the skeletons.”

Sui nodded as he readied his bow.

“And everyone else? No one enters this room until the skeletons are dead. And no one except Sui can hit the skeletons!”

The party agreed.

Sui used the space to fire a volley of flaming arrows at the three skeletons in the room. He shot one, knocking its head off. He shot another one, shattering its arm bone. The skeletons fought back with mocks and cackles, but Sui shrugged them off. He was too focused to worry about the skeletons taunts. He was very handily defeating them.

The party had agreed to not interrupt this epic battle, but Astalir didn’t hear Micro. When Micro was announcing the challenge, Astalir was unlocking the cage and opening it when Dralth jumped on him.

“I’m going to ride you deer!” Dralth kicked his side. “Giddyup!”

Astalir bucked wildly and finally got Dralth to get off. Dralth stammered backward to regain his balance. Yep, this party was crazy. Astalir ran off to avoid Dralth, running deeper into the maze. He unknowingly crossed the threshold that Micro had laid down.

“Deer! Get back here!” Micro tripped Astalir with his polearm.

Astalir crashed into the ground. A flaming arrow shot over his head, just missing his antlers. Astalir skidded to a halt, getting serious rug burn. Micro grabbed him and pulled him back out of the room.

“I said no one is to enter! Stay put.” Micro plopped the wounded deer behind him and continued to guard the threshold.

The skeletons mocked Sui, making him lose confidence. But Micro encouraged him, and he won. He exploded the final skeleton and learned a new trick when fighting with a bow that allowed him to attack faster. Sui high-fived Micro.

The party took a short rest. Astalir licked his wounds and got up.

“BLEEEAT!” Astalir gestured for the party to follow him through the maze, but they split up and went searching down paths that had already been searched.

Micro somehow found out about the sandwich that Astalir found and hunted him down.

Astalir smiled when he saw him, but ran in fear when he heard what he said.

“Give me sandwich! Or else!”

Astalir ran away, running for a trap. If he could dodge it, maybe Micro would step on it and get slowed.

But Micro was too fast, and caught Astalir by surprise. He grabbed him and kept him from escaping. “Where sandwich?” Micro felt around Astalir. Astalir’s true form was on display, but he hid the fact that he was wearing armor and a backpack. Micro felt around inside Astalir’s invisible backpack. “I know deer have. But where?”

“BLEEEAT!”

“I speak bleat, too.” Micro’s tongue glowed and stretched. It took the form of a deer’s tongue. “BLEAT!” (“Where sandwich?”)

Astalir was taken aback. “BLEEAT!” (“You speak deer?”)

Micro responded in deer, “I speak all animal languages. Now where sandwich?”

“Oh, you mean this sandwich?” Astalir telekinetically floated the sandwich out of his bag and over a trap. “What do you want with it?”

“Need to bring back party member.”

“Who?”

“Robot sniper guy. He drew bad card, he become sandwich.”

Astalir’s eyes widened, and he smiled. “Oh. Maybe I *should* eat it then.”

“No! Give!” Micro jumped for the sandwich, catching it in his mouth. He fell into the trap. The floor gave out from under him. A deep pit threatened to swallow him whole. But Micro was strong. He clung to the edge and pulled himself onto the ledge. “So that what red mark mean.”

Astalir ran away. He didn’t want to be there when the killer robot was let loose again. Astalir ran to the lobby area and waited for the party to finally arrive.

Finally, they did. They were all battered and bruised from all the traps in the maze. They looked utterly exhausted, except for Sui, who was still energized from his morning coffee.

It didn’t matter. All Astalir need was a distraction so he could go find the documents. Once they entered the room, he had free reign to search the area. It didn’t mattered if they died, his mission could still be a success.

The party, consisting of Sui, Silber Posten, Micro, Dralth, and a big tanky dwarf, entered the minotaur’s room as expected. Astalir waited in the lobby.

“Who dares enter Timmy’s throne room?” The minotaur yelled in minotaur. “I, Timmy, will devour you all!”

Timmy roared with all his might as the party collapsed on him.

Silber Posten tried to charge a magical shot but the sniper round came out as just a normal bullet. “It’s an antimagic field!” He ran for cover.

“Huh?” Sui turns to watch Silber Posten flee as he pulls his arrow back. He tries to engulf his arrow in flames, but instead pulls a muscle and drops the arrow. He loads another arrow and pulls back, pushing through his new weird muscle pain. But he pulls too far and his bow string snaps. “Crap! Now I gotta repair this!” He retreats to a side room. For safety.

The big dwarf, Dralth, and Micro rush Timmy, overwhelming him with weapon damage.

But Timmy is no push over: he strikes the dwarf and severely wounds him.

The party is doing exactly what they need to. What they need to for Astalir to complete his mission. He rushes into a side room and ransacks it. No documents, but he did find a treasure chest with some writing on it. “Treasure” it said. Nope, not what he was looking for. Astalir ran for the other side room.

Meanwhile, the battle raged on. The three melee party members crowd around him and draw his focus.

This gives Silber an opportunity to strike very precisely. He aims for Timmy’s eye and hit dead center.

But Timmy noticed it and used a wind rune to redirect the attack. It hit Micro square in the face. He didn’t take any damage from the bullet, but it bought Timmy time to counterattack. Timmy crippled the dwarf. The dwarf limped onto the ground.

Sui retreated during all this into the room that Astalir hadn’t yet searched. He found a document labeled “Timmy’s Weaknesses” and started reading it aloud. “Timmy is weak to snipers and mages. Thus, the antimagic field and numerous walls and pillars.”

Timmy heard this and grew enraged. He ran toward Sui to stop him.

Micro chased Timmy and safeguarded Sui’s exit.

Sui ran away, carrying the documents as he ran.

Timmy angrily activated his final form. He grew twice as big and healed some of his wounds. He attacked Micro with his full force, badly wounding him.

But Silber got another good shot onto him, which allowed Micro an opportunity to stun him.

Micro swept his legs and knocked Timmy prone. One more shot would kill him.

Astalir saw that the party was not doing what they were supposed to. They were stealing the documents! Astalir ran by Sui and sneakily grabbed the documents, and ran to the room where the other secrets were. He saw Timmy on the ground and thought it was safe to run past. But he was wrong.

Timmy was not dead, just on the ground. He swung his axe as Astalir ran past, slicing the deer in the chest. Astalir flew to his landing spot but didn’t land on his legs. He bled out. He had safely landed just outside the antimagic field, which meant he could use his powers. He shaped the water in his blood to flow back into his wound, and he molded the earth beneath him to cover his wounds up. It took all his focus to concentrate on this task as he lay there, hoping the party would kill Timmy so that he might live.

And the party did so. Silber’s bullet flew through the air and killed the prone minotaur. Timmy was no more.

Astalir watched with heavy eyes.

The party found that the throne was actually a door and slid it to the side. Underneath was a huge pile of gold.

“We’re rich!” They exclaimed. “This is much more than that measly 600 gold that centaur Max had promised us!”

They carried the gold and the wounded dwarf out of the maze.

But they left the dying deer in the room to die.

Astalir concentrated, steadying his breathing and focusing on his reality bending. It was all he could do to just stay alive.

Stupid minotaur. He was on the ground, probably dead. But no, he had enough in him to get one last strike on this poor deer. This poor deer who had been hunted by this party the whole time. They had just been an inconvenience to him. The whole time. And now they probably got him killed.

But Astalir didn’t have time to focus on how much he distrusted the party and how glad he was that Timmy was dead. It turns out that there were some monsters the party hadn’t killed. And they came to investigate Timmy’s death, now that the party had left.

Astalir thought fast. He put up an illusion wall so they wouldn’t see, but included a crack in it big enough for him to see through. The skeletons carried Timmy away through the maze, not paying attention to Astalir or his wall. Stupid skeletons. But at least his illusion worked.

Several hours later, Astalir’s condition stabilized. He let the earth regain its shape, and his blood didn’t leak out anymore. He sighed in relief. He was still in terrible shape, and likely had internal bleeding still, but at least he could move around without losing any blood.

He scoured the room for documents and gathered all that he could find. Satisfied with his haul, he ventured into the maze. The skeletons were too busy tending to Timmy for them to notice Astalir sneaking through.

Astalir got out of the maze and collapsed. Is this the end? He can’t seem to go any further. At least he retrieved the secret documents from the minotaur’s maze. He could rest easy knowing he exposed these evil secrets. He took one last glance at the setting sun, then closed his eyes.

The cool breeze blew over his wound, making him cringe in pain. His ears flitted about, and his tail flapped.

“Deer!” A familiar voice came from afar. Footsteps approached. The warmth of an old friend. “Don’t worry, I got you.” The warm hug of a morning sun pulsated onto Astalir’s belly. His wound sealed up properly, and his organs stopped hurting.

Astalir opened his eyes. It was someone he recognized! “Jodi!” Astalir leapt onto his feet and licked him with his long deer tongue. His tail wagged back and forth.

“Astalir!” Jodi exclaimed. “I’m so glad you’re alright!” He hugged him around the neck. “What happened?”

“That party was a real pain.”

“I’m glad I left.”

“Yeah but I needed them to fulfill my mission.”

“And what was that mission?"

“To expose these secrets to the world.” Astalir floated a pile of documents to Jodi.

“Body count for the year 1672, 1673… This is a count of how many people he’s eaten!”

Astalir nodded. “Hopefully this will bring some peace to the families who lost loved ones in there.”

Jodi nodded. “You did good work, Astalir.”

“Thank you.” Astalir wagged his tail. “Wanna go get some fruit or something?”

“Sure, I know a really good berry patch.”

Astalir and Jodi hung out a bit before Astalir had to go fulfill his mission. Lots of people found out about the extent of the minotaur’s body count. It led to new policy being implemented to prevent minotaur deaths in the future. Now for Astalir, it was a job well done. And now it was onto the next mission.

# Chapter 3 – The Goblin Camp

Sui the dragonborn dragon warden held the deck of random oddities in his hand. The morning sun reflected off the protective coating on the top card. Everyone was asleep, but since Micro the Bugbear had bought this deck for Sui, he couldn’t sleep. He drew a card that made it so he can rest without sleeping. Now he has to find ways to occupy his time while everyone sleeps.

He shrugged. “Why not?” He knew the risks, but he was bored. He shuffled the deck of random oddities and pulled the top card off the deck.

His stomach filled with butterflies that flitted about inside, giving him a bad stomach ache. They moved down his intestines and after a long, painful journey, made their way to his rear. He jumped out of his bed and pulled his drawers down. Three fairy-winged pixies popped out his pooper and fluttered around his room, shooting fairy dust everywhere. His bow and arrows started floating in the arrow, flying all over the place as the pixies darted around.

Sui managed to open a window and shooing all the fairies out without losing too many arrows. When the pixies left, all the floating objects fell to the ground. One arrow cut him on the arm.

He bandaged it up.

He sat back down on his bed. It was still not time for the others to wake up. He looked at the deck of random oddities, and stuck it in the bedside drawer. “Not doing that again.”

But then he got bored. “Maybe just one more card.” He pulled the top card off the deck and shoved the deck back into the drawer.

He immediately felt nauseous. He went to the window, but vomited all over himself before he could get there. The arm bandage dissolved in his stomach acid, as did part of his clothes and some of the floor board. He got some acid on his scales, but instead of dissolving, it healed the cut he got from the arrow. He looked at it inquisitively. “This is interesting!”

He went down stairs and asked the tavern keeper if he had any acid. The tavern keeper directed him to the alchemist shop in town.

Sui hustled to the shop, taking note that a strange “wild” deer was staring at him… and following him. He eyed the deer, but the deer pretended not to see.

At the alchemist shop, Sui requested the shopkeeper to throw acid on him. After some deliberation, they obliged. As Sui predicted, the acid healed him instead of hurting him. He had gained the power of acid absorption. “Thanks deck of random oddities!”

The alchemist requested to draw card. Sui sold him a card for 1 gold piece. The shopkeeper drew the card and became confused. It was an unlucky card; it caused the shopkeeper to lose some intelligence. Temporarily, but still. Sui put the deck away for good for the day.

Before leaving the alchemist’s shop, Sui bought a few acid potions for self-healing. Then he shut the door behind him to go back to the tavern.

Along the way, he spotted that deer again. It was definitely following him, while at the same time pretending that he wasn’t following and that he wasn’t being seen. “I see you, deer.” Sui eyed him. The deer just turned away and ate some leaves.

Back at the tavern, Sui met up with Max the centaur, who had a quest for them. No one else from the party showed; they were too worn out or debilitated by the last adventure. Some were deaf, some were unable to talk, and some were just too tired from their fight with Timmy the Minotaur. So Sui was the only one available for this new quest Max had for them.

A goblin camp had kidnapped a centaur and bound him. Max wanted them to free him. So Sui grabbed his bow and acid potions and headed out.

A deer tried to follow him discretely, but it was very obvious. “Don’t you mess up this mission, deer!” The deer looked away and ate some grass.

Sui got to the goblin camp and climbed a tree to scout the situation. The centaur was bound in the opposite corner. The brush was too thick to sneak from behind; the only way to get to him was through the goblin camp. And in the camp, there were several goblins sitting at a table. One had special markings of him and was bossing everyone around as they ate their breakfast.

“These guys look dangerous. But if I have to go through them all, I will. Just stay out of my way, deer.”

The deer flicked his tail. He scraped an antler up against a tree and pulled off a piece of bark.

“Here we go.” From his treetop perch, Sui drew his bow and shot the goblin leader in the chest.

The goblin leader got up from the table yelling in pain. He ripped the arrow out of his chest, only for another one to stab him through the head. He collapsed to the ground.

The other goblins pointed at Sui and angrily drew their weapons, which was mostly bows and short swords. One goblin shot him in the shoulder. Another shot him in the gut. A third, panicked goblin pulled back his bow so far that the string broke. He looked at his bow in panicked shock. Then he looked at Sui just in time to see an arrow hit him in the face.

“Skill issue.” Sui said smugly.

The goblins all came running at Sui, more weapons at the ready. Sui realized he was in deep trouble. He couldn’t fight all these goblins alone. So he reached out to the only one here who wasn’t actively fighting him.

“Deer! Deer!”

The deer looked at him and cocked his head.

“I need you! Help me!”

The deer shrugged. A spark of light traveled up his antlers.

All of a sudden, Sui saw two left hands, two right hands, and two bows. “What the?” It was like he was splitting in two, like mitosis. But he didn’t feel any pain. The copy of him jumped out of the tree, ran at the goblins, and hid behind a tent.

Sui stared at it in bewilderment for a moment, until he realized that the goblins were just as confused. The goblins shoot their arrows at his clone, but they all go right through it, causing no damage. Some goblins rush to the clone and strike it with a melee weapon, also going through it and causing no damage.

“Well done, deer.” Taking this moment of relief, Sui pulls the arrows out of his body and pours acid on the wounds. They seal up perfectly, no pain. He draws his bow and shoots a goblin in the back. It falls over dead. He shoots another one.

The goblins realize they can’t kill the clone and that there’s another Sui, the real Sui, that can still bleed. They run up to the tree where Sui’s at, bow drawn. He shoots it right at Sui’s head.

Sui falls over off his branch and swings on it with one arm. The arrow whizzes past his face. He looses an arrow as he drops to the ground, hitting one square in the chest. He hides behind a bush and draws his bow. He can just barely see a goblin through the bush, and aims through it. His arrow spins through the air like a drill, pushing all the bush branches aside. It contacts the goblin’s forehead and caves in its skull, popping his head like a balloon. Goblin blood and brains blew everywhere.

Sui climbs back up the tree, using the tree as a shield as he climbs. The goblin arrows hit dead center in the tree. He shoots the remaining goblins and they fall to the ground. Now that there are no arrows flying past his face, he scouts the camp again from his perch.

All the goblins in he could see were laying on the ground dead. The table had food on it, and around it were several tents. Sui waited a bit to see if there was anything in the tents, if anything would come out of it.

Something did come out, but not from inside. A strange goblin walked out from behind a tent and unzipped the front, as if to go in. But then another goblin came out and yelled at the strange goblin to get lost. A burning coal from the morning cookout floated up and into the tent goblin’s pocket. His pants caught on fire and he ran around trying to put it out.

As he did so, the strange goblin entered the tent and rummaged around, throwing things out of the tent left and right. It appeared to be looking for something. Satisfied that nothing was there, the strange goblin left the tent and the firepants goblin, heading to the next tent.

And again, there was a goblin in that tent, too. This goblin kicked the strange goblin in the rear and yelled at him.

“So it seems that all these tents have goblins in them.” Sui squinted at the tents. “But I can’t see through them. I’ll have to wait for them to come out.”

As if reading his mind, his clone started to move again. It unequipped its bow and unsheathed its short sword. It walked menacingly toward the three goblins.

The strange goblin didn’t hesitate. It pulled out its short sword and ran at Sui’s clone, giving its best battlecry.

Sui drew his bow, but had a funny feeling he should hold back. “Let’s see what this clone is made of.”

The clone swung his sword at the strange, charging goblin. The goblin fell over backwards and dropped his sword. The clone plunged his sword into the goblin, and blood poured out of its wounds.

“Holy poop!” Sui let his bow down. “This clone is brutal!”

The clone turned its attention to the other two goblins who just got out of their tents. The firepants goblin was so scared, it not only peed itself, not only pooped itself, but also backed up and tripped over backwards over the breakfast fire pit. He passed out and burned alive.

The clone pointed his sword at the other goblin. That goblin turned tail and ran, tripping over the edge of the tent as he went. He escaped the camp into the woods.

The commotion woke up the rest of the goblins. A whole half dozen more goblins appeared out of the tents.

“Bingo!” Sui readied his bow.

The goblins are stared at Sui’s clone, trying to figure out what to do from a distance. One goblin approached and realized it wasn’t real, and called it out to the other goblins. But he stepped too close to the strange goblin that the clone straight up murdered, and all of sudden that goblin wasn’t dead anymore.

The strange goblin pulled out a dagger and stabbed the yelling goblin in the foot. It yelled out in pain.

“What the? Goblins can’t resurrect themselves, right?”

Another goblin came to help, and pointed at the strange goblin lying in a pool of blood on the floor. The jig was up.

The strange goblin dissolved to reveal the body of… the deer! The strange goblin had been the deer in disguise this whole time! And there wasn’t a scratch on him!

Sui chuckled. “Clever deer!” He drew his bow. “Don’t worry, I’ll get you out of there.” Sui shoots the goblin that exposed the deer’s true form. It fell over before it could get its weapon out.

That was all the opening the deer needed. It jumped over the fresh goblin corpse and dashed into a tent. It jumped out and ran to another tent.

The goblin next to it tried to stab it as it ran past, but the deer deflected the blade with its antler. The goblins then tried shooting the deer, but all their shots missed. The deer hid in the tent and they couldn’t see it anymore.

Sui shoots both the goblins that shot at the deer. Dead, dead. No there were no more goblins in the camp. “Well done, deer.”

Sui climbed out of the tree and inspected the goblin camp. Bodies lay everywhere. The breakfast food was ruined, unless you like your food with a side of blood and guts. The tents were all intact, except for the ones the deer ran through.

“What are you doing?” Sui watched as the deer ran into all the tents, kicked all the stuff out, and then ran to the next tent. The deer ignored him and continued doing what it was doing. “You’re definitely not a normal deer. Some kind of magic deer. I trust you know what you’re doing.”

“Mmm! Mmm!” The centaur lay on the ground gagged and bound.

Sui tried to untie him, but his fingers were too sore from shooting his bow. He couldn’t undo the knots. “Screw it.” He unlatched a potion bottle from his belt. “Careful, this might sting a bit.” He dripped acid out of the bottle onto the ropes. They dissolves away in a line that circumvented the need to undo knots.

“Thank you, my dear dragon.” The centaur spoke in Sylvan as he shook off the loose ropes. “I am freeeee!” The centaur ran off, jumping over the bloodied table as he ran.

Sui approached the table. The goblin leader lay on it, spilling his guts all over it. Sui patted him down, searching for valuables. He pulled out his scimitar, his shield, and some loose change. “This will be worth selling.” He examined them. Then he found a javelin. He looked at it coyly. “I’ve got an idea.”

Sui thrust the javelin into the ground and lifted the goblin leader’s body onto the opposite end. The body drifted down, skewered on the javelin pole. Sui clapped his hands together. “Let this be a message to all who mess with us!”

No one heard it. But they would see the skewered goblin, if they ever came to the camp. Not even the deer was paying attention.

Sui approached the tent the deer was in, holding his hands up to block flying items from hitting his face. “Deer?”

The deer stopped and looked at him.

“What are you doing?”

The deer squinted at him, then after a moment, shrugged. It walked next to him, as if to be petted. Its shoulder fur parted, revealing a map. The map detailed the where abouts of an encampment, and the inner tunnel system of a cave network. There was a date and timestamp written in the corner, freshly written.

“So you found this in these tents?”

The deer nodded. It looked at the ground. There was a falcata sword on the ground next to a bag of 50 gold. A spark of magic traveled up the deer’s antlers, and the sword and bag floated up into the air.

Sui held out his hand to receive. The sword floated along and into the deer’s fur, becoming completely concealed. The bag of gold disappeared similarly.

“Wait, you’re not sharing?”

The deer cocked its head, then shook it.

“What if I gave you a free card from the deck of random oddities?” Sui pulled the deck out of his pocket. “Only 1 gold!”

“BLEAT!” The deer yelled. It ran out of the tent.

Sui ran out after the deer, but tripped on a shiny helmet. “What? Why would the deer throw this out?” The helmet was really fancy. Sui realized that this tent must be the goblin leader’s tent. “Hmm…” He got an idea. He found all the fancy pieces of armor strewn around the camp and put them on. He laid down in the goblin leader’s tent and went to bed. “Can’t find me…” He yawned as he fell asleep.

# Chapter 4 – The Kobold Cave

The sun was coming up and his lips were getting chapped. After hours of walking through the night, it was a relief to finally find a tavern. Grarthta Swanfallow, a pale green 7ft half-orc, entered and ordered a beer. After taking some long, refreshing gulps, his stomache rumbled.

“Hungry? I can cook you up something.” The dwarf behind the counter said.

“You have meat?”

“Sure do. Would you like beef, chicken…”

“Do you have venison?” Gra licked his lips.

“I’ll check the back.” The dwarf put down the glass he was cleaning and went into the kitchen.

While he was gone, a dragonborn walked sleepily down the stairs and sat next to Gra. He nodded at him.

Gra nodded back.

The dragonborn yelled from his seat. “Hey! Anyone there! I’m hungry!”

“Wait just a bleeting minute!” The dwarf yelled from the back. Finally, he returned, empty-handed. “Sorry, we’re fresh out. We got beef though.”

Gra settled for beef and the dragonborn also order breakfast. They introduced themselves when Max came in. Gra found out the dragonborn’s name is Sui, with an *i*.

“Glad to see you both met already. Adventurers come and go, and this is your new partner, for now.” Max told the dragonborn. “We have a problem with a kobold cave. Here’s how to get there.” Max told them the info they needed to know and they left the tavern.

Outside, an old man was sitting next to the steps. “Aaalms for the pooor?” He held out a tin cup to Sui.

“This is my deer friend.” Sui told Gra.

“Well it’s your choice who you keep around.”

“No, *deer* friend. You know, hooves and antlers.”

“Deer?” Gra drooled. He tried looking at the old man’s face. “He looks human to me.”

“Come on, deer, drop the disguise. We know it’s you.”

“What?” The old man pulled his hands into his hood. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Come on, out with it.” Sui reached to grab the old man.

The old man ran off, but a deer showed up where he was sitting. It stood there, staring at Sui, rather crossly.

“See? I told you. Deer.” Sui grabbed onto the deer’s antlers, but his hand passed through them. “Your antlers aren’t real?”

“I’m gonna get me some deer!” Gra grappled the deer’s neck, but his arms passed through it and he fell to the ground. He swiped his hands through the deer’s body. “It’s an incorporeal deer? What kind of species is this?”

“Wait, have you been ethereal this whole time?” Sui started questioning his sanity. “I thought for sure I saw you interact with objects.”

The deer ignored them, pointing to and stomping on a piece of paper on the ground.

“What’s this?” Sui picked it up. It was a map of the kobold cave, with certain things circled.

“Something very useful to our mission.” Gra took it.

The deer disappeared.

Gra’s looked at the spot the deer once occupied. “Huh, that’s strange.”

Gra and Sui followed the directions that Max gave them to the kobold cave. Along the way, they found a bridge of ice going across a stream. It was weird because it was summer.

Gra looked and saw a deer eating some tree bark. “Deer!” He jumped across the river and ran at the deer. The deer just ran away. Gra chased but the ground beneath him became suddenly uneven, slowing him down. The deer got away. Gra stared at it as it left. “Soon.”

Sui jumped across the river and stopped Gra. “That’s my deer friend. He’s a magic deer. Don’t kill him.”

Gra holstered his axe. “No promises.”

They got to the kobold cave and Gra looked at the map one more time. “It looks like this main path is blocked by boulders. We’ll have to take this side path.”

They entered the cave, weapons drawn. It was dark, but Gra could see just fine with his dark vision.

Sui, however, tripped over a stone.

“Are you ok?”

“Yeah, I’m fine.”

“You didn’t see that rock?”

“It’s dark in here.”

“That’s what your darkvision is for.”

“Oh, right.” Sui chuckled. “Let me turn that on real quick.”

Gra gave him a strange look.

Sui tripped over another rock. “I knew that was there.”

“You… you don’t have darkvision, do you?”

Sui sighed. “No.”

Gra sighed and pulled a torch out of his bag and lit it. “Here.” Gra handed Sui the lit torch.

“Thanks.” Sui took the lit torch in his mouth so he could two-hand his bow.

“Stay behind me, things could get ugly.”

They found the side path. It was hidden behind a 10ft blockade of rock. But the ceiling was 30ft high, so they easily climbed over it. They snuck down the narrow side path.

“Get back to work!” A flying kobold spoke in draconic as it whipped something from behind a rock.

“But we’re hungry!” Some kobolds in another room complained. “Can’t we just have some of that stew brewing on the campfire?”

“Such insubordination!” The flying kobold whipped again.

Gra’s stomache rumbled. He showed himself to the flying kobold.

The flying kobold flew up to the ceiling and shouted, “Intr—”

Sui shot it out of the air. It fell to the ground.

Audible kobold gasps came from the room to their right.

“Can’t have them swarming us.” Gra ran into the intersection. Peeling off a patch from his cloak, he tossed it at the ground in front of the whipped kobolds. A door sprang up out of the patch, blocking off the flightless kobolds from reaching Gra. A handle presented itself to Gra, but he didn’t open it. He signaled to Sui that it was clear.

“What’s this door here?” Sui asks.

“Don’t worry about it.”

They stalked down a narrow corridor to the main hub room, where a bunch of kobolds were sitting around a campfire. The smell of the stew wafted into Gra’s nostrils. “Ah, venison!” His stomache rumbled. “Soon.”

Suddenly, the ground trembled. Small tremors shook the cave. Gra and Sui clung up against a wall. It felt like they were coming from the cave entrance.

“What’s that trembling?” A kobold held the pot in the campfire.

“I’ll go check.” A kobold got up from the campfire and approached the hallway where Gra waited patiently.

Another tremor hit. The kobold holding the stew lost his balance and knocked the pot over, spilling venison stew everywhere.

Sui took the opportunity to shoot an arrow through him and another kobold, who was flying above, whipping the cook. Both fell to the ground, dead.

The kobolds all got out of their seat and looked around.

The kobold investigating the tremors tripped and stumbled right into Gra. He looked up at him, terrified. “In… in… Intruders!” Then this 3ft kobold stabbed Gra in the chest. But, instead of the dagger piercing Gra’s skin, the blade bent sideways, rendering the dagger useless.

Gra grinned. “You shouldn’t have done that.” He lifted up his battle axe with both hands and slammed it to the ground, cleaving the kobold right down the middle.

The kobolds all looked on in shock as they witnessed the brutal death of one of their kin.

The hulking half-orc stepped into the light, dragging his bloodied axe behind him. “Who’s next?”

“Get him!” Yelled a brave kobold. He rushed in, stabs Gra, bending his dagger. But his courage was infectious. The other kobolds grabbed their slings and hit Gra with everything they had. Stones flew across the room directly at Gra, hitting their mark.

The stones all bounced off Gra’s chest. One grazed his ear, cutting him. But no serious damage was done.

Gra yelled in rage, “Come at me!” The pelting stones didn’t slow him down. His eyes, filled with determination, stared at two kobolds standing on a bench. He approached them, axe dragging behind him, and he spoke in a steady, stern voice, “Follow or die!” He spoke in fluent draconic.

The two kobolds dropped their weapons and hugged each other. They nodded at Gra, necks shaking.

“Good.”

Sui shoots a few more kobolds, killing one with an arrow between the eyes.

Gra looks around the room, looking for the next big kobold group. Instead, he sees something unusual. A kobold twice the size of a regular kobold shuffles its lanky legs up the main corridor, into the main hub room, and dashes into the nearest hallway out of sight. “Weird.” He scans the room again.

A group of 3 kobolds huddled together on a bench. They shoot him with their slings. When he gets close, one shanks him with his dagger unsuccessfully. They gulp as he towers over them.

Sui follows Gra’s lead. “You better come with us if you want to live.”

The kobolds spit on him.

Gra yells at them, but the kobolds don’t cower.

“We’re not scared of you!” yells one kobold in draconic.

“Well, perhaps you’ll listen to logic then. If you don’t want to die, I’m your new leader. Got it?” Gra swung his axe onto his shoulder.

One kobold whispered to the other one, and then they both bowed to Gra. “We accept.”

“Good.” Gra was satisfied that he now had 4 kobold underlings. And he only had to kill seven kobolds to do it. “Not bad for a start.”

Out of the corner of his eye, Gra caught it again. The lanky tall kobold ran out of the side room and into another side room. According to the map, all the side rooms were dead ends.

Gra turned to Sui. “Have you ever seen a kobold that big before?”

Sui pointed. “If I had to guess, that’s my deer friend. He does that.”

Gra licked his lips. “Deeer…” He pushed a kobold forward, speaking in draconic, “Go into that room—”

“With that big kobold?” The kobold asked.

“Don’t interrupt me! Go into that room and keep that big kobold from getting out.”

“Yes, boss.” The kobold ran and stood in the entrance. He came face to face with the most unnaturally tall kobold he ever saw. It stared intently at him. He shook in place, but stood in the door nonetheless.

“We’re getting some venison today!” Gra picked up the pot and put it back on the campfire.

==========================================================

It was getting to be midday and Frill the kobold was getting hungry. He moved another rock to block the main entrance stairs. He took a rock from Sylla, and heard her stomache rumble.

“You’re hungry too?” he asked her.

Sylla nodded.

“I’ll get us something to eat.” Frill jumped down from the ledge he was on and walked down the hall to the main hub room, where a campfire was brewing venison stew.

The flying kobold stopped him. “Get back to work!” He whipped him.

“But we’re hungry!” Frill jumped back.

“Such insubordination!” The flying kobold whipped him again.

As Frill sat on the ground, he saw a shadow lurk up towards the flying kobold.

“Intr—” The flying kobold fell to the ground, an arrow in his chest.

Before Frill could react, the shadow turned into a giant orc and then a door appeared at his feet, blocking the path. Frill glanced at the door, but didn’t see a handle. He yelled to Sylla, “Run!”

Sylla and the other three kobolds didn’t see what happened and had just thought Frill had gotten whipped again.

Frill climbed up the wall and over the boulders that blocked the main entrance stairs. “There’s intruders! We gotta go!”

“Intruders? Then we gotta go kill them!” A scarred kobold said. He saw the door, and instantly knew there was only one way out.

“Let’s go!” Frill looked at the main hallway entrance on the other side of the rock blockade. There was a boulder on one side that wasn’t there before. “Odd…” He approached it.

“Frill! Help!” Sylla cried out. She was having a hard time climbing the rocks with the other 3 kobolds trying to push past her.

Frill reached out a hand to help her up.

“Thanks! Wait, that wasn’t there before.” Sylla approached the boulder.

The other 3 kobolds scrambled up the blockade.

Suddenly, the boulder turned into a deer!

“Deer!” Frill shouted excitedly.

“Food!” Sylla licked her lips.

The deer jumped away as Frill tried to grab it. A yellow spark flowed up its antlers and the ground shook. The deer ran down the main entrance toward the cave opening. Behind it, the ground moved. A pit as wide as the tunnel and as deep as a kobold’s height sank down into the ground, and behind a wall the same width and height grew out of the dirt.

The ground shook, knocking Frill and Sylla off their feet. The other 3 kobolds fell off the blockade and landed at the bottom of the stairs.

“Don’t worry, brothers!” Frill yelled. “I’ll get us that deer, and then I’ll save our other brothers from the intruders!” Frill charged forward, jumping over the pit and grabbing onto the edge of the wall. He climbed up with ease.

“Frill, wait!” Sylla cried out. She jumped down into the pit and then climbed up the wall. Slowly, but steadily.

Frill got to the top of the wall and saw the deer. He pulled out his sling and shot it.

But the deer dodged and jumped over the blockade into the side path. Its antlers sparked, and the ground shook. Another pit and wall combo formed in front of Frill.

“A magic deer, huh? I bet you’ll be even tastier!” Frill long-jumped from the top of the wall to the second wall. He grabbed onto the edge, skipping the second pit altogether. Then he jumped to the blockade blocking the side path.

The magic deer was just on the other side of it. Its antlers sparked again, and again the ground shook.

Frill braced for the tremors. The ground in front of the blockade went down, and the blockade that Frill stood on went up. It was now a 30ft drop from the top of the blockade to the bottom of the pit. But Frill didn’t have to land in the pit. He could land just beyond it, on the other side of the curve of the side path. It would be tricky, but he could do it. He jumped off the blockade and bounced off the wall, landing awkwardly on the other side of the pit. He made it, but he hurt all over. He tried to get up, but his arms wouldn’t move. Neither would his legs. “Help!” He squeaked out. He watched the deer escape down the side path deeper into the cave.

Sylla climbed down the first wall and climbed slowly but surely down the pit and up the next wall.

Two kobolds were lagging behind Sylla, trying to figure out how to climb the wall. But the third one, the scarred one, figured it out fast.

“No time to waste!” The scarred kobold raced past her, carelessly jumping over the walls with some agile movement. Sylla didn’t see, but the scarred kobold climbed the 20 feet up the side path blockade and jumped over the landing to the other side. “Ahhhhhh!” And then a *THUD!*

“I’m coming!” Sylla climbed the side path blockade and examined the situation. The scarred kobold was bleeding out its head at the bottom of the pit, and just beyond the curve of the side path, she could see a kobold tail twitch. “Frill!” She climbed down into the pit and up out of it. She ran to Frill’s side. “Are you ok?”

“Can’t… move…” Frill cried, taking big heavy breaths.

Sylla took him in her arms. “It’ll be ok, Frill. It’ll be ok.”

“I didn’t get the deer, Sylla. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t worry about it. You’re going to get better, ok?”

Frill whined. His neck went limp and his heavy breathing stopped.

Sylla hugged him tighter and cried.

# Chapter 5 – The Kobold Hierarchy

“What are you doing?” Sui asked Gra.

Gra got up from his pot. “Preparing a meal.”

“No, there’s more kobolds here.”

“Right, right.” Gra pointed to an unexplored side path. “I’ll go here.” He walked noisily into the side path, fe-fi-fo’ing his way into the room at the end. In draconic, he yelled, “Alright, you cowards!” He looked into the room.

A bunch of kobolds were shivering in a corner. A yinglet slept tied up against a wall.

“You either join me or die!”

The kobolds shivered.

“All with me, stand up and come here.” He pointed in front of him.

5 kobolds do as he says, but two stay cowered in the corner.

“C’mon, one kobold whispers. He’ll kill us all if you don’t listen!”

Another kobold took the hand of the 2 scared kobolds and dragged them into position.

Gra nodded. “Very good. Keep that one tied up for now.” He motioned to the yinglet. “I’ll be back.”

“We’ll be here.”

Gra came back to the main hub room. He found the sentinel kobold sitting around the campfire, instead of guarding the tunnel like he asked. “You! What are you doing?”

The kobold fell off his seat. “I… I…”

“Why aren’t you guarding that room?”

“It escaped! You said it was a deer in disguise, right? It ran off to the main entrance.”

“You let it escape?”

“It jumped over me!”

Gra gave him a disapproving glance.

“Gra, come here!” Sui whispered from the other side path. “There’s more kobolds in this room.”

“Wait here.” Gra told the kobold, before joining Sui. “Don’t worry, I got this.”

Gra stomped into the room and frightened the whole group of 7 kobolds.

Meanwhile, the lanky kobold Gra was trying to stop poked its head out of the fishing room and into the main hub. The sentinel kobold saw it, but was to scared to disobey Gra’s last order of “wait here.” The lanky kobold walked awkwardly across the main hub room and into the room where the yinglet was being held.

Inside, the 7 kobolds were all discussing amongst each other what to do.

“We wait here, just like he said.”

“But what if he’s planning on rounding us all up and killing us?”

“If he wanted to kill us, he would’ve done so by now.”

“Yeah, he’s probably going to become our new boss.”

“Maybe he’ll be kinder than our current boss?”

“Probably not.”

Then the lanky kobold appeared in the doorway. The kobolds all gave him funny looks.

“Who are you?”

But before they could approach, things went flying across the room. Blankets and bedrolls flittered in the air, pillows hit them in the face, and barrels rolled around.

“Mm? Mmm?” The sleeping, gagged yinglet woke up for a brief moment before fading back into slumber.

The kobolds got on the ground and put their hands over their heads.

Things settled down when a bunch of bananas rose out of some bed sheets, hung in the middle of the room, and then dropped onto one of the kobolds.

“I thought I said no food in bed?” A kobold scolded.

“I get snacky at night.”

In the midst of the chaos, the ropes around the yinglet were loosened. But the yinglet didn’t move, except for its stomach while breathing.

Then the lanky kobold left, and the dust settled.

“What was that?”

“Definitely not a kobold.”

Back in the other room, Gra told his new kobold recruits to await further instructions. “And if you see a lanky kobold, let me know immediately.”

“Yes, sir.”

Sui came in after Gra and yelled at them. “You all better stay in line!”

“Is that the lanky kobold?” A kobold whispered to another.

“Stupid kobolds!” Sui yelled. “I’m a dragonborn. Clearly! You better behave or you’ll die by Gra’s hand!”

The kobolds cowered and let Sui pass.

In the next room, Gra frightened two kobolds, but the last kobold, who could fly, stood his ground.

“You’re not budging, are you?”

“No! I will not join you! You are a murderer!”

“Prove your loyalty.” Gra placed a hand on each of his two new recruits from that room. “Convince your mate.”

The two kobolds pleaded with the flying kobold to relent. He didn’t. They offered him bananas, copper coins, a washrag, but nothing worked. Finally they promised not to complain about his orders ever again. He gave in, but with some conditions. “I want my own section of kobolds. A *whole* section.”

“Done. Will these two work?”

“Yes. But I require a few more.”

“Ok, we’ll work out the details later. Right now, hang tight.”

Gra heard whispering, but didn’t see another room.

The kobolds fidgeted.

“But, to prove *your* loyalty, you’re going to tell me where your other kobold friends are hiding.” Gra held his axe up to the flying kobold.

The flying kobold reluctantly flew up to a perch 10ft off the ground. Behind it, was another tunnel leading to another room.

“You’ve done well. I’ll make sure you get your section.” Gra climbed up the wall and roared.

Behind him, Sui was waiting with a bow and arrow, and more choice words ready for the flying kobold leader. But before he could enter, a deer fell onto the ground in front of him and turned around. It pointed at the passage to the main hub room.

“Deer!” Sui shouted. “Why are you here? Can you please not interfere!”

The deer looked shocked. He continued pointing, ears down.

“Get out of our business.” Sui pushed past the deer, but his hand went through the deer. “Stupid deer.” Sui arrived in the room with the flying kobold and his two underlings. “You guys better not screw anything up!”

The lanky kobold ran across the main hub, following the sound of Sui’s shouting. It tripped once, but got back up and entered the next room.

The kobolds there stared at it questionably. “That is one strange kobold.”

“Is it the lanky kobold?”

“I don’t know, it just could be a short dragonborn.”

“Well, should we ask?”

“You ask it.”

One kobold got pushed forward to ask the lanky kobold what it was. “Are you a dragonborn or a kobold?”

The lanky kobold looked down and stared blankly. Then the room flew into chaos. Rocks darted around the room, blankets popped up and floated down, and barrel corks shot out. The kobolds all cowered in fear.

“It’s not a kobold! It’s not a kobold!”

A book appeared out from under a pillow. It gently lifted itself into the air, making a journey somewhere else.

“My bedtime stories!” The kobold closest to the book grabbed it and held it close. It stopped moving on its own.

“What’s all that racket?” Sui yelled from the other room.

The lanky kobold hid behind a barrel, and the spectral deer stood in front of him.

Sui looked around the room. “Did you do this, deer? You better not be harming any of our kobolds!” Sui turned to the kobolds. “Did this deer hurt you?”

The kobolds gulped. “N-no…”

“I swear, deer.” Sui marched on. “I’ll deal with you later, right now I have more important matters to tend to.” Sui left to go the main hub room.

The lanky kobold moved on to the room with the flying kobold leader, and tore that room apart to. From behind the wall, Gra could be heard talking to the last group.

In that room, there were a bunch of barrels, and more kobolds. One taller kobold with green scales huddled close with his most loyal subjects. Once Gra stepped into the room, the other kobolds cowered behind him.

“Who… who are you?” The kobold chieftain stood up to Gra.

“I’m the guy who just took over your entire settlement. So are you going to join the ones standing with me or the ones lying on the floor?” Gra points his axe at the kobold chieftain.

The kobold chieftain flinches.

“I’m taking over entirely. What I say goes. But I’ll need delegates, so you’ll still have authority, somewhat. What say you?”

The kobold chieftain nods. “Ok. Just don’t hurt my subjects.”

“Alright, now that that’s settled, follow me to the campfire. We’re going to have a meeting.”

The kobolds followed him.

The lanky kobold panicked when he heard Gra approaching from the other side of the wall. It hid behind a treasure chest.

Gra climbed over the wall and noticed that the room was a mess. “What happened here?”

The flying kobold pointed to the corner.

Gra saw the cowering lanky kobold and grabbed at it. It dodged, and jumped away, but hit its leg on the treasure chest. Gra grabbed its leg and pulled it in. “I don’t know what you are, but you’re not getting away.” He held it under his arm. It looked really weird. Although Gra was holding on tight, it looked like he wasn’t touching it at all. He carried the lanky kobold to the main hub room, with the other kobolds behind him.

============================================

“Frill! Friiill!” Sylla cried, holding him in her arms.

“Sylla, what happened?” Another kobold appeared at the top of the wall. It approached.

“Stop!” Sylla yelled.

The kobold came closer, getting to the edge of the wall.

“Don’t! It’s too deep!”

The kobold looked confused. “What?” It shrugged, and hopped down. “Aaaahhhhh!”

Sylla gasped. She shut her eyes, so she wouldn’t see what happened to her friend. Blood splattered onto her face, including her eye lids. A scurrying sound came from the other side. It was the last kobold in their section.

“Go away!” Sylla yelled. “Run! Don’t climb! Run away!”

The kobold stopped climbing and ran away, out of the cave.

“At least I saved one of my friends.” She wiped away a tear. “But this will not stand. I’m going to get that deer!”

She marched down the side path, past the iron door, and into the main hub room, where five kobolds sat around an empty pot. “What’s going on?” She tiptoed around the dead kobolds.

“We all work for Gal now.”

“No, it’s Growl.”

“I heard Bra.”

“Who?” Sylla asked.

“This big green ogre—”

“Orc.”

“Whatever. This big green orc who came in, sliced a kobold in half, and scared us.”

“You mean he’s still here?” Sylla’s brows furrowed.

“Yeah, and he’s super scary. You don’t want to mess with him.”

“How can you call yourself a kobold?” Sylla scolded. “We live and die to become dragons! Do you think some orc cares about that? No! He’s going to have us digging tunnels and gathering food while he puts his feet up and takes a nap!”

The other kobolds winced. They hung their heads in shame.

“We have to stop them. We have to get our fellow kobolds back on our side, and take care of these intruders!”

“You’re right, Sylla. We should’ve been braver.”

The other five kobolds stood up, ready to fight. “Now what?”

“Let’s go gather our friends.”

Suddenly, a dragonborn appeared from a side room. “Are you planning what I think you’re planning? You better get back in line before Gra finds out!”

The five kobolds cowered behind the stone seats around the campfire.

“On second thought, we can’t become dragons if we’re dead.”

“Please, Sylla, understand!” A kobold got on his knees. “We can’t beat this guy. Our weapons do nothing.”

Sylla sighed, and shelved her fire. “Ok. I’ll join you guys.”

The kobolds sighed. “We’re going to live!”

“We’re going to survive.” Sylla whispered to herself, holding a special rock that Frill had given her.

===================================================

Gra marched up behind Sui, holding the lanky kobold. “Everything ok?”

“Yeah, just keeping the kobolds in line.” Sui saw the lanky kobold. “Is that you, deer?”

“If it is, it’s going to make a good meal.”

Sui sighed. “Don’t eat him. He’s a magic deer.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah. It wouldn’t be good food.”

“Hmm. Ok. I won’t eat this deer.” Gra assured.

The lanky kobold flickered and turned into a deer.

“I knew it was you.” Sui exclaimed.

Gra stomped to the middle of the room, and the kobolds there looked at him expectantly, their mouths drooling. “No, we’re not eating this deer.”

They looked away.

Gra turned to the kobold chieftain. “Gather your kobolds, we’ll have the meeting here.”

The kobold chieftain did as told.

The kobolds guarding the yinglet brought him with them, tied up with a single rope around the arms and waist, and held onto it with the rest of the rope, like a leash.

Gra started the meeting once all the kobolds were there. He stood ontop a seat to increase his height advantage. The deer was still tightly held under his arms, which helped grab the kobolds’ attention. “I have an announcement. I am your leader now. You will do as I say and exactly as I say it. I will not tolerate insubordination or disrespect towards me,” he motioned to himself and Sui, “or my colleague dragonborn here.”

The kobolds licked their lips. One started setting the pot on the campfire, another went to fetch water.

Gra shut it down. “And there will be no eating this deer. Understood?”

The kobolds hung their heads, except for Sylla, who stared angrily at the deer.

“You will be reprimanded if you even touch a hair on this deer’s back.”

Sylla didn’t drop her gaze.

“Hey, Sui. Go talk to that kobold.” Gra whispered, pointing Sylla out.

“Sure.” Sui stepped through the kobold crowd and grabbed Sylla’s wrist. “Come with me.”

Sui led Sylla to the fishing room. “What’s your name?”

“Sylla.”

He could tell she was different. She was covered in dirt and blood, and her facial expression hid a rage that made her fearless. “What happened to *you*?”

“A gauntlet of pits, walls, traps, and despair. I lost two of my close friends, and my single, very best friend. *That’s* what happened.”

“You don’t have to be so rude.”

Sylla looked away. “After Growl killed our section leader, and put up that iron door, my section ran the other way around.”

Sui nodded. “Yeah, *Gra* blocked your path so you chased us the long way around.”

“And along the way,” Sylla’s fist balled, “we ran into that deer. That very same deer that Gra is holding.”

“And?”

“And I want to rip its antlers off, chop them in half, and stab it with its own antlers.”

“But why?”

“It killed my friends!”

“But how?”

“I don’t know how it did it, but it shook the ground, and made pits to trap us, and walls to discourage us. And it made a really big wall and really deep pit. My best friend fell to his death, chasing that deer.”

“There’s no pits in the entrance.”

“I know! The deer made them appear.”

“Show me.”

Sylla started off, but Sui grabbed her again.

“But just in case, I’m going to tie this rope around you, so you don’t escape.”

“Seriously? I live here. Where do you think I’m going to go?”

“Mmm. Ok.” Sui dropped it.

Sylla led Sui to the place where Frill died. The pits were gone, but there were three dead kobolds, like she said. Two of them had went splat and had their heads cracked open.

“Well, I don’t see the pits.”

“But the bodies are still here!” Sylla pointed. “The evidence is right here!”

“Yeah, and we can’t have bodies blocking our entrance. They’re going to have to be moved, pronto.”

“You’re not the boss of me.”

“Did you hear what Gra said? Insubordination will NOT be tolerated.”

Sylla eyed him. “Ok.”

“Now move these bodies.”

“Where to?”

“Anywhere, just so they’re not blocking this path.”

Sylla picked up one of her friend’s arms, but the body didn’t move.

Sui sighed. “You’re not strong enough, are you?”

“No.”

Sui picked up the three dead kobold bodies with ease. Frill’s lifeless arms flung over his shoulder, tapping the heads of the other two kobolds. His eyes stared directly into Sylla’s, dead and lifeless. Sui carried the three bodies out of the cave and dropped them unceremoniously on the ground.

“You can’t just dump the bodies like that!”

“Why not?”

“They need a proper burial!”

“What for? They’re just kobolds.”

Sylla stewed. She started digging.

But Sui stopped her. “Come on, we’re going back to the meeting.” He dragged her back to the campfire in the cave.

“And we will be expanding this cave system.” Gra was still giving his speech. “Plans will be drawn soon, and you will follow the plans. If you have questions, do not be scared to ask me.”

The deer turned into Sui. “What the deck man! Put me down!”

Gra raised an eyebrow at the Sui in his arms.

“That stupid deer switched me out! It’s getting away! Put me down so I can go after it!”

“Very clever, deer.” Gra squeezed hard, making the deer drop his disguise. “But you’re not very good at copying Sui’s voice. He’s more skiddish.” He looked back at the kobolds gathered around.

Sui returned with Sylla. He seemed to have some news.

“And that is all for now. Go to your quarters and have a good rest.”

The kobolds scattered, pouring out into the side tunnels. As they left, a book floated out of one of the kobold’s hands. It floated over and into the deer’s fur. The deer smiled.

Gra got off his podium and approached Sui. “What’s up with her?”

Sui pulled Sylla forward. “Her friends died chasing that deer. Something about a pit.”

“A pit? There’s no pits there.”

“Do you remember those tremors we felt? That was probably the pits forming.”

“And you think this deer did that?”

“Well,” Sui stared into the deer’s face. “I’ve never seen it do that before, but it’s possible. Some spell like Mold Earth or something.”

“Well, deer?” Gra squeezed gently.

The deer hung its head in defeat. A spark flowed up its antler. The ground shook, and Gra braced himself. The column of dirt Gra stood on rose 10ft into the air. Under Sui, the ground dropped 10ft, putting him in a pit.

“So it was you. Wow, that’s… useful.” Gra smiled. “You can put me down now.”

The ground shifted back to normal, shaking the ground as it went.

“What’s your name, deer?”

The deer shrugged.

“Come on, I know you have a name.”

“BLEAT!”

“In a language I can understand.”

The deer didn’t say anything.

“Stop being difficult! Tell him your name!” Sui yelled.

“Hey don’t scream at it!” Gra shut him down. “Come on deer, I know you can talk.”

The deer hung its head. A spark flitted up its antler, and letters appeared on the ground in front of Gra.

ASTALIR

“Alistar? Like that one guy?”

Astalir shook his head.

“Oh, it’s switched. Asteer… Astaril… As-ta-leer. Astalir?”

The deer nodded.

“So, Astalir…” Gra sat on a bench next to the campfire. “What do you do?”

SURVIVE

“Hmm… interesting. We’ll have to talk about that later.” Gra put a log on the campfire. “But I meant, what do you *do*? Like, as a job.”

“I think he’s a wizard or something.”

“Sui, can you go get the prisoner?”

“What?”

“The yinglet. In that room over there.”

“Hmm. Ok.” Sui left to fetch the yinglet prisoner.

“So, you were saying?” Gra took a sip from his waterskin, still holding Astalir tight under his arm.

INFO ACQUISTION

“Info acquisition? So, like a spy?” Gra held his waterskin up to Astalir’s mouth.

Astalir shook his head no.

“Well, then I’m afraid I don’t quite understand.”

Sui returned with the yinglet, standing him in front of Gra.

Gra turned him around and untied him. “Who are you?”

“This one is called Gale, Gale Wind, of the desert.” The yinglet spoke with a timid voice.

Gra pat the seat next to him, opposite Astalir. “Sit down.”

Gale sat next to Gra.

“So Gale, why do you speak of yourself in the third person?”

“This one has always done it, since birth.”

“What happened to you? How did you end up here?”

“This one woke up here. This one was camping in woods, when kobold scum knocked this one out.”

“I’m Gra, now the leader of these kobolds. Sorry to hear that my new recruits did this to you. I’ll have a talk with them.”

“This one was wondering what was going on. This one thanks you.”

Astalir turns into the yinglet.

“What’s that one?”

“Don’t worry about him.” Gra pets Astalir on the head through his disguise. Astalir turns back into a deer.

Sui shuffles a deck of cards. He holds it out to Gra. “Want to draw one?”

“What is this?”

“Deck of random oddities. I got some random buffs from it already.”

“I could use some buffs.” Gra drew a card. His eyes popped wide open, and his grogginess faded. “Wow, I feel wired!”

“Oh yeah I got that card too. I haven’t slept in days!”

“That’s good news. Not sleeping will make things easier to keep.” He gave Astalir a squeeze.

Astalir looked dismayed. His brows furrowed and his ears pinned back. He kicked the air with his hind leg.

“Now don’t try to escape. I’ll let you go when I know I can trust you.”

“How about you?” Sui held the deck out to Astalir.

A card floated off the top of the deck and to Astalir. He looked at it. He didn’t feel any different, and nothing seemed to change.

“What that one do? This one not see.”

“I don’t know, but do you want to draw a card?” Sui held the deck out to Gale.

“This one will give it a try.” Gale drew a card. His pupils dilated to fill his whole eye socket. He got down on the ground and wagged his kangaroo-like yinglet tail. His ears flopped. “Bark! Bark!” He put his forepaws on Gra’s lap and panted.

Gra let out a big laugh. He ruffled Gale’s head a little. “Who’s a good doggy? Who’s a good doggy!”

“He got the dog card! He’s acting like a dog!” Sui pointed.

“Another mastiff for my collection.” Gra commented. He picked up a stick and threw it.

Gale ran awkwardly on his short forelimbs and long, kangaroo-like yinglet legs. His body wasn’t made for quadrupedal movement, but he made do. He grabbed the stick in his mouth and returned it to Gra.

“This is hilarious!”

A minute or two later, Gale’s eyes go back to normal. He looks down at the stick in his mouth and the floor he’s all fours on. “Bleh!” He spits out the stick, stands up, and dusts himself off.

“Do you want to draw again?” Sui stifled a laugh.

“Blasted cards!” Gale pushed the deck away. “This one will not be doing that again!”

“Shit man, that was probably the hardest I’ve laughed in years! Here, for your troubles.” Gra reached into his bag with his single free hand and pulled out four gold pieces, handing it to Gale.

“This one did not enjoy this, but is glad you enjoyed it.”

Gra gave him a hearty slap on the back.

Astalir’s antler sparked. His pupils grew to fill his eye, his ears flopped to the side of his head, and his tail wagged enthusiastically. “Bark! Bark!”

“You too, Astalir?” Gra turned to Sui. “They both got the same card?”

“Ha! That one’s dog-minded!” Gale pointed and laughed.

“No…” Sui examined the deck. “There’s only one card of each type.”

The stick floated up to Gra’s free hand. “Bark! Bark!” Astalir’s tail wagged and his tongue hung out.

Gra stared intently into Astalir’s eyes, and eventually saw through the illusion. “Nice try, Astalir.”

Astalir hung his head, and he returned to normal.

“You really are a clever deer, though.”

After an hour or so, Gale fell asleep. While Gra and Sui talked, Astalir pulled out the book he found in the kobold’s room. It was a diary written in Aarakocra, a language the kobolds most definitely couldn’t read. It told the daily struggles of an Aarakocra living in the mountains. Astalir read through it, completely engrossed.

Gra laid down next to the campfire, and Sui did too. Gra held onto Astalir, not letting him get away.

“So what’s your plan for this cave?” Sui asked.

“Well it’s going to be our new base of operations.”

“So you’re staying in town?”

“It looks like it. I don’t have any home to go to. This one will do.”

“How are you going to manage all these kobolds?”

“That’s what I have you for. And we’re going to designate some kobolds to be leaders.”

Astalir shifted to get comfy despite Gra’s arms and closed his eyes, as if to go to sleep.

“Which ones?” Sui hugged an arrow close to his chest.

“Obviously, the green scaled one. He’s going to be directly below me, after you. The winged kobolds make natural leaders, and one in particular is good at inspiring others.”

“Speaking of inspiring, I have a suggestion.”

“Yes?” Gra asked.

“That blue-hooded one, Sylla. She is very inspirational. The kobolds follow her.”

“Yes, I was thinking of her as well. We will have to give her her own “section”, as they call it.”

“Yes.”

Gra and Sui didn’t fall asleep. Astalir tried to stay awake, but fell asleep after a few hours of getting comfy. He didn’t know what Gra was going to do with him, but he knew he needed to come up with an escape plan. Tomorrow. He will sleep on it and do something tomorrow.

Astalir fell asleep, laying his head on the cave floor.

================================================

An hour or so later, when everyone else was asleep, Gra got up, carrying Astalir with him, and walked to the cave entrance. They both looked up at the moonlit sky. Stroking his head, Gra gently asked Astalir, “Survivor?”

Astalir cocked his head.

“You said that what you do is survive. What did you mean by that?”

Astalir looked away. He hung his head in sorrow. Then, a single spark made its way from the base of his antlers all the way to the furthest most tip.

Illuminated by the moonlight, cave drawings appeared on the cave wall. A god arose, holding its hand closed. A brilliant light radiated from within his hand, and when he opened them, several deers stood there in his palm. The deers descended to earth, running around living their best lives. Flowers, bushes, trees sprang up around them, becoming a forest. Then the god became cross, and rained lightning on the deers. One by one, the deers fell, and the ones that remained fled.

Gra’s countenance fell. Astalir refused to look, but his face was contorted, eyes closed, brows furrowed.

The deers that survived ran to a different forest. Humans came, bows at the ready, and hunted the deers down. Of the original deers, only 4 remained. They all ran away, but in separate directions, running off the edge of the cave wall. Finally, one deer remained. That deer shifted into an old man, into a commoner, into a goblin, into a kobold. That deer came across a yellow dragonborn and a pale green orc, and followed them into a cave.

“I see.” Gra nodded. “Gods have done me no favors either.”

A single tear dropped from Astalir’s eye.

Gra set Astalir on the ground, but held a hand on him. “I see now why you distrust people. But I don’t think your avoidance is justified.”

Astalir cocked his head.

“You’re safe here, with us. If you want to stay, that is. None of us here have any plans of harming you.”

Astalir looked defiantly into Gra’s eyes.

“If I let you go, will you try to trust us and rely on us, at least a little?”

Astalir lowered his eyebrows.

Gra shrugged. “Ok. I get it. But at least check in once in a while, just so I know you’re alive?”

Astalir gave a single nod.

Gra took his hand off Astalir.

Astalir looked around, and up and down Gra. Then he ran away, but didn’t. A deer ran off into the night, and a deer stood there in front of Gra.

“You’re not real, are you?” He asked the deer in front of him.

The deer shook its head, accidentally passing an antler through a wall.

“Can you see through this thing? Is it like a familiar?”

The deer shook its head again. It stomped its front hoof. Below it, a shiny object glimmered in the moonlight.

“What do we have here?” Gra picked it up, receiving a static-shock from it. It was a steel falcata, with the initials “MG” expertly carved into the blade. “Is this for me?”

The deer nodded, then disappeared.

“Thank you, Astalir.” Gra whispered into the night.

# Chapter 6 – The Aarakocra Map

Over the next week, Gra started several projects in the kobold cave: food supply, entrance maintenance, and education. He hunted deer (non-magical), rabbits, and fish to feed the kobolds. He organized a project to restore the main entrance. He taught the kobolds about how to live among humans without causing problems. Sui helped oversee all these projects.

One night Gra was out hunting. He shot an arrow at a deer, which landed in its back. And then he chased it. It ran all the way to the stream before he managed to grapple it. He pushed it down into the stream and held its shoulder to the flat rocks below. Blood trickled out of the deer’s arrow wound into the water. With his free hand, he headlocked the deer’s neck, despite its protests. Two well-placed fingers held the deer’s eye open and stationary. Gra stared into them.

“Hmm… you don’t look magical to me.”

He then carried the deer out of the water and laid it on dry land, where he stepped on its shoulder to get a clean slice to the head. “I’m sorry.” The deer’s cries of pain instantly stopped. “Please rest in peace.” He picked up the deer carcass and walked back with it.

Along the way back to the cave, he ran into Sui. “Everything ok?” Gra asked.

Sui grumbled. “The kobolds peed in the river again. I’m going to go get sanitary drinking water.”

Gra sighed. “We’re going to have to teach them better hygiene.”

“I’m trying, but they don’t listen to me.”

“I know. But hey, I got something special today. Some fresh venison and some spices I got from town.” Gra enthusiastically opened his bag of holding to him.

“That sounds delicious.”

“Yeah I’m going to put it in the pot when I get back to the cave.”

“Just please, don’t use the water from the cave river.”

“Oh right. Would you mind fetching us some clean water?”

“For some venison stew? Alright.” Sui walked off to the stream.

As Gra walked back to the cave, he looked up at the moon lighting the night sky, the same moon that Astalir used to illuminate his cave drawings. Where was he now? Hopefully, wherever he was, he was doing alright.

Gra got close to the cave, and found something peculiar: Sui walking into the cave. “Huh? How did he get back faster than me? Hey Sui!” He yelled, but he was apparently too far from the entrance for Sui to hear.

Sui disappeared into the cave. He didn’t seem to be holding any water containers or anything.

“Have I been staring at the moon for that long?” Gra walked briskly into the cave, passing the side path, and going straight for the metal door he “installed” the first time he entered. He knocked.

“What’s the password?”

“Gra is boss.”

“Oh! It’s you boss!” The smooth metal door opened. Behind it stood a small kobold, standing at command.

“At ease.” Gra walked through. “Tell me, when you opened the door for Sui, did he have water on him?”

“No, boss.” The kobold closed the door. “Sui walked in silently from the side entrance.”

“Ok, I’ll have a word with him. Thank you.”

“You got it, boss.”

Gra carried the deer carcass to the campfire. As he set it down, the kobolds squealed in joy, tugging and tearing at it. Gra shooed them away. “This is for dinner tonight. No touching until the stew is done.”

The kobolds all pulled their hands back.

“Sylla?” Gra turned to a blue-hooded kobold.

“Yes, …boss?” Sylla sat on a bench.

“Keep them in line while I go talk to Sui.”

Sylla nodded. “You heard him! Claws off!”

“Did you see where Sui went?”

“He went that way.”

“Thank you, Sylla.”

Gra walked down the north tunnel that led to three different side rooms, the last one being the treasure room. When he heard the sound of coins clinging wildly, he stopped and moved along stealthily. He climbed the wall and into the tunnel that led to the treasure room and found something odd.

Sui was standing by himself in the treasure room, looking around as coins flew all around him. Coins popped off the ground and into the air, darting left and right, filling the air with a crazy amount of projectiles. Sui stood calm and still in the center, watching as if it was normal.

“Sui?” Gra entered the room.

Sui turned to Gra, a look of panic on his face.

Gra stopped moving. He cocked his head, squinting at Sui. As Sui froze, it became clear: Sui faded into a ghost, and underneath him was a walking deer. “Astalir?”

Astalir dropped the disguise and reared up on his hind legs, swinging his hooves wildly.

“Hey, hey.” Gra waved his arms down. “I just want to talk. I’m not going to grapple you. See?” Gra put his hands behind his back and leaned up against a wall.

Astalir flicked an ear and looked at Gra from the side.

“First of all, it’s good to see you. How’ve you been?”

Astalir made munching motions with his mouth.

“Hungry? How about these?” Gra pulled out some berries and presented them in his palm.

Astalir raised an eyebrow. The berries floated up to him, and one by one he inspected them. Then they floated into random positions around him, and he picked them out of the air with his tongue. As he swallowed, he smiled. His tail wagged.

“Ah, you like those.” Gra’s belt started moving on its own. A bag untied itself from his belt and was floating away. Gra reached out and grabbed it. “Uh-uh. If you want more you have to answer some questions first.”

Astalir huffed, but then waved his nose, looking directly at Gra.

“What are you doing here?”

A flicker of an antler, and a word on the ground.

SEARCHING

“For…?”

INFORMATION

“In the treasure room?”

BERRIES

Astalir got closer, letting his sniffing nose lead the way.

“Not yet.” Gra held the bag close. “What are you doing making a mess in our treasure room?”

Astalir rolled his face dramatically.

SECRETS

“You won’t tell me?”

SECRETS!!

“Oh… you’re *looking* for secrets!”

Astalir nodded.

“Well, I’ve been here for a week, and I haven’t found any secrets yet. So I think you can stop searching.”

OBLIVIOUS

Gra laughed. “Ok, if you think you can do better, have at it.”

Astalir nodded. The room flew into a frenzy again, coins flying everywhere.

Gra held up an arm to block coins from flying into his face.

Finally, after several minutes, the coins settled.

“So?”

EMPTY

“See? Are you ready to come out now?”

Astalir’s antler sparked as he got on two legs, transforming back into Sui.

“I’m going to choose to not see through that this time.” Gra commented to himself. “Ok, Sui, you ready to go?”

“Sui” nodded.

Gra led Sui to a side room, where he told him to wait. He walked into the main hub room, where some kobolds were preparing dinner.

“Do you think the dragonborn has firebreath?” A kobold asked as he stirred the pot.

“If he did, it’s awfully strange that he never volunteers to light the campfire.”

“Well, maybe he’s got other dragon gifts. Like magic?”

“Yeah but he only knows the spell, ‘Raise Voice’,” a kobold scoffed.

“I haven’t seen him cast magic, but I believe he can.”

“I doubt he does. But why do you believe?”

“One day, before we become dragons, we’ll become dragonborns. And when we do, we’ll have some semblance of the power of our elder brethren.”

Another kobold sighed in happiness. “That’ll be the day.”

Gra entered the room. “Have you seen Sui?”

Sylla pointed. “He’s in the fishing room cleaning the pot.”

“Thanks.” Gra peeked in and checked real quick. Sui was indeed in there cleaning the pot. Gra motioned to other Sui to come out.

The kobolds stared as they watched the dragonborn come from the north tunnel and go into the entrance tunnel, scowling at Gra when he passed the deer carcass. They cocked their heads so they could watch him leave through the metal door. Then they all scurried into the fishing room, where they found Sui still cleaning the pot.

“But… he was leaving… how did he get over there?”

“He *is* magic! He *is* magic! Dragonborns are higher beings!” The kobolds ran around cheering and hugging each other.

Even Sylla smiled. “I guess there is hope afterall.”

Outside the cave, Gra and Sui walked into the moonlit field. The gentle breeze blowed cool night air across their hair.

“Thanks for stopping by, Astalir. I hope to see you again soon.”

Sui transformed back into Astalir. “Bleat.”

“It’s your voice! It’s good to hear your voice!”

“BLEAT!” Astalir wagged his tail.

Gra smiled and laughed. He loosened his grip on the bag.

The bag of berries dislodged itself from Gra’s grasp and gravitated toward Astalir. “Bleat!” He smiled.

“You’re welcome. Enjoy!”

“Bleeeat!” Astalir ran off, pocketing the berry bag.

“Goodnight!”

Over the course of the next few weeks, Gra made significant progress on the kobold cave. The main entrance was easily accessible, the side path was blocked off, the kobolds had plenty of food, the kobolds practiced better hygiene, and they were starting to make tradable goods. Gra was quite pleased.

Every night, Gra stood outside the cave entrance, waiting for a deer call. When Astalir came, Gra gave him some berries. Astalir usually took the berries and ran off, bleating happily away. As the weeks went on, Astalir went from running off with the berries, to eating the berries in front of Gra, to eating them straight out of his hand. His sniffing nose tickled Gra’s hand. And after a while, Astalir even let Gra stroke his head fur while he ate the berries. Every night Gra would feed him berries, and every night Astalir would grow a little closer to him, and then bleat off into the woods.

One night, about 5 weeks after Astalir first snuck into the treasure room, Gra stood outside the cave entrance like usual. But this night, Astalir was a little late.

Gra decided to call for Astalir. “BLeAt!” He gasped. “bLeeEEaaaT.” He didn’t quite get the sound right.

“What’s going on out there?” Sui yelled from inside.

“Just practicing my deer call.” Gra yelled back. “Everything’s ok.”

“Ok, goodnight.”

“BLEEEEEaat!” Gra tried. He failed miserably.

A light chuckle came from the edge of the forest.

“Huh?” Gra investigated. A small tree shook uncontrollably. He poked it.

The tree toppled over onto the ground, chuckling all the way. On the ground, it turned into none other than Gra’s favorite magical deer.

“Astalir!”

“BLEEEaaT! BLeeeeAAAAttt!” Astalir mocked, rolling around on the ground.

Gra chuckled. “It’s good to see you too.”

“Bleat! Bleat!” Astalir stood up on all fours.

Gra patted his head. “How you doing buddy?”

“Bleat! Bleat!” Astalir pointed his nose up, ears perked, tail wagging.

“I got your favorite.” Gra opened the bag of holding, pulling out a pile of blueberries.

Astalir pulled his nose back in shock, furrowing his brow.

“What’s wrong?”

Astalir sniffed into Gra’s bag of holding. He pulled out a chunk of deer carcass.

“Oh. Sorry, I forgot to wrap that. The smell bothers you, doesn’t it?”

Astalir stared at him, side-eying.

“Hmm, you probably don’t like me eating deer meet, huh? I’m sorry, Astalir, but I have to feed my kobolds. But don’t worry, I only eat non-magical deer. And I only hunt for survival.”

Astalir stared for a second, then relaxed his expression. He licked Gra’s hand, and then presented his forehead, shoving the deer carcass back into the bag of holding.

“I’m glad you’re not mad at me.” Gra petted his head.

Astalir ate the berries from Gra’s hand, then licked his hand clean of berry juice. “Bleat.”

“Glad you liked it! What have you been up to lately?”

“Bleat.” A book appeared in front of Astalir, opening itself. Astalir scanned the pages as they flipped past, and then the book closed and disappeared.

“You’ve been reading? About what?”

A winged bird humanoid appeared, flying through the air. When it landed, Astalir pointed a hoof at it.

“Some kind of bird humanoid?”

A map floated out of Astalir’s fur and into Gra’s hands. It was hand drawn in ink on parchment; a painstakingly-drawn, yet incomplete, rendering of the surrounding area and a route to a mountain range. A thin, dotted line led to an X at a point called “Wind’s Crossing”. The X lit up on the page.

Gra nodded. “This is where the bird people are going?”

Astalir shook his head. He pointed a hoof to Gra, and then to himself, and then to a silent image of a mountain.

“Us? *We’re* going there?”

Astalir nodded.

“So you’re asking for my help?”

Astalir nodded.

Gra grunted, squinting at the map. “Astalir, this is a long journey, by the looks of it. We’re still working on the kobold cave. We can’t just leave.”

Astalir stared into his eyes. “Bleat?” He faced down but looked up.

“It’s important, huh?”

“Bleat.” Astalir nodded.

“Ok. I’ll make some arrangements. When do we leave?”

“Bleat-bleat.” Astalir reared up and did a 180. Gra’s hand pulled him forward.

“Now?” Gra stood his ground. “Hold on Astalir, let me go make some preparations.”

“Bleat.” The map floated up to Gra’s face, and a dot labeled “The Fiery Inn” glowed. “Bleeat.”

“Meet you at the tavern?”

“Bleat bleat.” Astalir nodded.

“Ok, I’ll meet you there within the next two hours, ok?”

“Bleat bleat.” Astalir jumped away. “Bleeeeaat!”

“See you soon!” Gra waved.

A drop hit his hand.

“Looks like rain.”

Gra gathered some supplies for the trip, and let the kobolds know that they would be going on a long trip. He put the kobold chieftain in charge, with Sylla as second-in-command. Sui and Gale accompanied him when he left for the tavern.

It was pouring rain and lightning as Gra, Sui, and Gale trekked through the night.

“Can’t this wait until morning?” Sui complained, running behind Gra.

“No.” Gra ran in front, leading the way.

“Why not?”

“I don’t know.”

“Well I don’t see why we’re going on this mission in the first place.”

A lightning flash revealed a stream coming up ahead.

“Just trust me.” Gra grabbed Gale and jumped clear over the stream, landing in the mud on the other side. He set Gale down gently.

“This one wishes we wait for after storm passed.”

“Me too.” Sui agrees, landing next to Gra.

A lightning flash, a rumbling, and a roar.

Gra puts an arm out, holding the party back. “Wait here.”

Sui readied his bow and arrow, and Gale drew his scimitar. They scanned the environment.

Gra approached a bush. He swiped a hand across it, but nothing was in it. “I swear I heard something.”

*SNAP! ROOOOAARR!*

An owlbear charged out from behind a tree at Sui! It bit into his side with its beak, and slashed at his shoulder with its claws, leaving a deep gash. It stepped forward, pushing Sui to the ground. It raised a claw to hit him again.

Gra bumrushed the owlbear, knocking it off balance, and off Sui. He pulled his battleaxe off his back and slashed its side.

The owlbear roared in pain.

Gale laid his hands on Sui, helping him to his feet. His hands glowed, sealing the shoulder gash and the stomache wound.

“Thanks.” Sui drew an arrow and unloaded into the owl bear.

The owlbear roared again, but this time, it sounded more like a cry for help. Four roars replied.

Gale turned to the sound. In the dark rainy night, four round shapes approached along the river. Lightning flash. Four bears snarled, their eyes angry.

Gale jumped. “This one advises getting out of here!”

“You stay off my friend!” Gra didn’t hear Gale as he battled the owl bear.

Gale ran up and tagged Gra in the stomache. “These ones should get going!”

Gra swung his axe, nearly hitting Gale. “I don’t advise touching me right now.” When he turned, he noticed the four bears approaching. “Oh shit.”

The bears had gotten close enough that they were basically surrounded.

“Sorry, Gale, it looks like we have to fight this one out.” Gra tightened his grip on his battleaxe’s now slippery wet handle.

“This on will fight to dead!” Gale yelled. But then his tone became fearful. “But hopes he has not to.”

Sui gulped, feet shaking. He missed two arrows aimed at the bears. “I can’t see shit!”

“Yeah now would be a good time to turn on your darkvision.”

The bears took off in a sprint at the party, charging the party.

A flash of light, but no thunder. Suddenly the muddy water around the bear’s feet hardened up their legs. The bears tripped on their faces. The mud turned into ice, freezing them in place. A flash of lightning revealed the source: a deer with sparking antlers just on the other side of the stream.

“*Astalir*!” Gra gasped to himself. “Sui! Gale! Focus on the owlbear!” Gra roared, landing a hefty blow onto the owl bear.

Gale slashed its legs with his scimitar, slowing it down.

Sui shot at it with his bow, but kept missing. “Screw it!” He dropped his bow and pulled out his shortsword. “RAAHHH!” He charged forward, until he felt a beak and fur. He plunged his sword into the beast’s flesh, wherever he could find it. He punctured a major artery and it started bleeding.

Gra kept an eye on the bears. They struggled to break free of the ice, but being as strong as they are, it didn’t take them long. Two bears broke free and swam against the stream to get to the other side. One broke free and charged the party, heading straight for Gale.

Gra gave the owlbear one last slash before lunging forward to punch the charging bear in the face. Bone cracking assured Gra he had shortened the bear’s snout.

It stumbled back, but didn’t dawdle. It got on two feet and came down onto Gra’s shoulder, biting deep into his shoulder.

“RROOOOOAAAAAHH!” Gra roared in rage. His muscles bulged, the veins on his head popped, and his eyes filled with red. He swung his axe wildly at the bear. “ROH! ROH! ROOOH!”

The bear bled with each slice. It fell down, trying to get up.

One of the bears that crossed the river came back across it, choking, but making great time. It rammed its frozen friend, breaking it free from the ice. The two bears roared as they approached, igniting the fire in the wounded bear’s eyes.

It got up and slashed Gra in the shoulder. The two other bears charged up from behind it and grabbed each of his hands in between their teeth.

Gra’s grip failed him and he dropped his axe.

“This one holds your candle!” Gale thrust his yinglet hand forward at Gra, streaming golden light onto his back. That light flowed over Gra, presenting itself as holy golden armor plates.

“ROOOHH!” Grar yelled. He clenched his fists, grabbing the tongues of each bear. He twisted and pulled the tongues, forcing the bears to move at his discretion. He crashed them right into each other. Water droplets sprayed up, creating a mist.

The bears let go of his hands, stunned on the ground for a moment. The third bear reared up and slashed at him, but its attack just glanced off the golden armor on his chest.

“ROOOH!” Gra picked up his battleaxe. He lifted it up and swung it into the bear’s skull, splitting it in two.

“Bleat! Bleeeat!” A painful cry came from across the river.

Gra turned to look. Astalir was being cornered by the fourth bear. A splash of water hit the bear, swallowing itself into the bear’s mouth.

The bear choked and gagged, but made one last swipe at Astalir, knocking him into the river. The river iced up around where Astalir fell.

“Astalir!” Gra yelled. The red drained from his eyes as fear and worry filled his thoughts.

Meanwhile, the two bears got up from the ground. They lept onto Gra while he was distracted, knocking him to the ground. The golden light armor protected him from a few attacks, but the bears broke through it.

Gra was taking blow after blow. His chest looked like it had gone through a meat slicer, and his hands were mangled meat twigs.

“Graaaa!” A voice raged from behind a tree. With a slam and pound, the bear miraculously rose off the ground.

The bear screeched and clawed at the air, but was unable to hit Gra. One by one, its limbs clung to its body, becoming completely immobilized.

Gra got out from under the bear, seeing a familiar face standing next it. It was none other than… *himself*! “Thanks, Gra!”

“You’re welcome, Gra!” His clean, uninjured face smiled back at him.

The bear roared.

“Oh shut up!” New Gra snapped. He looked at the bear aggressively, and it started choking, its esophagus visibly collapsing.

Gra swung his axe through the air, killing it instantly.

A roar replied from across the river. Gra turned to look. The fourth bear slashed the ice structure in the river, and then swam across.

Out of the ice structure floated a hump with a bunch of sticks attached to it. Gra gasped. It wasn’t moving, not even a little.

“Astaliiiir!” Gra ran to the river, jumped in, and grabbed the hump of flesh. It was deer in form, complete with a set of antlers. Gra grabbed it in his arms, ignoring the pain from the multiple lacerations on his arms. He refused to let his broken fingers let go. Gra brought the hump of flesh onto land, and gently laid it down. “Come on, Astalir, come on.”

Gra put a hand on the lump of flesh. It was cold, like an ice cube. Its chest was torn open, ribs poking out. Its legs were mangled and frost-covered. The hump didn’t show any signs of motion, save for a faint heartbeat. It got slower and slower.

Gra’s heart beat rapidly in his chest. “Astalir, come on Astalir. What do you need? Um, you’re cold! Your cold.” Gra picked him up, letting his own broken index finger snap backwards. He hugged him close. The lump’s head leaned up against his. Its cold, dead eyes stared into his own desperate eyes. He stared into them. “Show me a sign you’re alive!” But there was no magic in those eyes. “Help!”

Gale rushed over. “Is that one dead?”

“No! No! No! Help!” Gra laid the lump down so Gale could lay his hands on it.

Gale did so, but his hands flickered out when he lit them up. “This one is out.”

“Suuii!”

“Would an acid potion help?” He poured one onto his leg, and it healed instantly.

“Is this deer your friend?” New Gra approached.

“YES!”

“I will help.” New Gra stood next to the lump, and it lifted into the air. The frost fell off and the lump melted. Its neck, once frozen stiff, now let the head lean to one side. The torso contracted and convulsed. The lump gagged and water spewed from its mouth.

The deer’s lungs moved the chest in and out in a rapid cycle. Its breathing was rapid and frantic.

New Gra looked at Gra’s open arms, and the deer floated down into them. “It’s stable, but it needs medical attention ASAP.”

Gra reached for his cloak to peel off a patch. His broken fingers wouldn’t cooperate. “Gra, this one!”

New Gra nodded and ripped off the patch in question. It was a maroon patch in the shape of a potion bottle. As it leapt off the cloak, it expanded into a round potion bottle with a red bubbling liquid. New Gra held it firmly in his hand as he flicked off the cork and poured the contents down the throat of the deer.

The deer blinked. It looked around.

“Astalir?” Gra whispered to it.

Astalir looked at him, eyes wide.

“Deer? You ok?” New Gra asked.

Astalir looked at New Gra, and then back at Gra. He squirmed in Gra’s arms, rolling out onto the ground, landing on all fours. He jumped left, and he jumped right. Two deer landed in the mud a few feet from Gra and ran away, limping heavily.

Gra waved to both of them with his messed up hands. “Bye!”

“Will it be ok?” New Gra asked, getting ready to chase one.

Gra motioned to stop. “It’s fine. Let him go. He can take care of himself from here.”

Gale groaned.

Gra stood up. “Oh right! Party check! Is everyone alright?”

Sui joined up. “I’m fine, but…” He turned an empty vial upside down. “I’m all out of acid.”

“You do acid?” New Gra asked.

“Well, yes… but you don’t have to phrase it like that.”

“This one is injured, needs rest.”

“Let me see.” Gra inspected the wound. “Looks like a night of rest should fix that right up.”

“Is there a tavern near here?” New Gra looked around.

“This way.” Gra led.

Gra, Sui, Gale, and New Gra journeyed through the rain and dark to the tavern. They tended to their wounds. Gra got his fingers bandaged up until Gale could have a good rest. They got some food and ale, had some fun getting the edge off after a stressful encounter, and then headed to bed. Gra paid for the rooms.

After everyone had gone to bed, Gra walked out to the tavern porch. He let the rain pelt him as he stepped in the light puddles. He looked at the staircase. There was no old man there asking for loose change, just an empty spot of dirt.

Gra leaned on the porch railing and called out, “BLEeeeEEAAAaaaT!”

He listened, but there was no reply. No friendly bleat, no mocking laughter, no approaching deer friend.

Astalir was supposed to meet them there at the tavern that night, but he was nowhere to be found.

Gra sighed. “I hope you’re alright out there, wherever you are.”

# Chapter 7 – The Cat’s Coat

On the side of the road this fine summer’s day, a little old shopkeeper, who was most definitely your average shopkeeper, set up shop along the side of the road. His wagon of supplies was parked and blocked, his display table was set up, and his most lucrative items were on full display. Now all he needed was some guinea pigs—uh, customers. He needed customers.

The first one of the day made a grand entrance: a blue swirling smoke sphere grew into a portal between some trees, and out stepped a humanoid silhouette. In a brilliant flash of light, the portal vanished. A black-furred tabaxi with green eyes, wearing a hood, approached the shopkeeper’s stand.

“Welcome to Don JeLancie’s Department of Joy. What can I do for you today?” The shopkeeper motioned to his display items.

“What do you have in winter clothing?” The tabaxi looked over the items.

“Going someplace cold, I see? How about this winter coat bundle? It includes everything you need: gloves, pants, boots, the works.”

“This is exactly what I need…”

“And?”

“But it’s not magical. Do you have any magical coats?”

“I don’t *have* any, but I can make one. What do you need it to do?”

“I want it to go in the air.”

“An airborne winter coat?” Don JeLancie laughed.

“Why? Is it ridiculous?”

“Yes.” Don JeLancie settled down. “Which is just my style.” He took the coat back, holding it from the collar. “Who do I have the pleasure of enchanting this chaotic item for?”

“Drathalion Treescorn, the famous interplanar traveler.”

“The *famous* interplanar traveler? How have I never heard of you?”

Drathalion shrugged. “I try to keep to myself.”

“Uh-huh. I’ll be right back.” Don took the coat into his wagon and shut the door behind him. Drathalion perked an ear to listen in. A hint of light squeaked through the seems in the door. Then Don emerged with the coat. “Here you go, one enchanted coat that lets you go in the air.”

Drathalion grabbed an edge and felt it. She could feel magic running through it. “Thank you.”

“That’ll be 500 gold.”

“Five… hundred?”

“Yes.”

Drathalion took out her coin purse, counting her coins. “How’s 200 sound?”

“Like not enough.” Don took the coat back. “Come back when you have the coin.”

“Hold that item for me. When Drathalion, the great interplanar explorer returns, she’ll want that.”

“Very well. You have 24 hours before I sell it.”

Drathalion nodded and walked down the path.

When her back was turned, Don snapped his fingers, and a fly appeared from a bright flash. The fly was tiny, but upon close inspection, one could make out Don’s face on the fly’s head. Don flicked the fly, hitting Drathalion on the shoulder. The fly was so light she didn’t feel it.

Don snapped his fingers again, causing a pair of fly-eyed goggles to appear on his face. Inside, he could see out of the fly’s human face.

“Let’s see who this “interplanar” visitor is, hmm?”

He watched as Drathalion walked down the path for an hour or so to the nearest town, where she came upon a tavern. She seemed to know her way around the town, as if she had been there before. The tavern was empty on the front, but there were several people inside. Drathalion entered. The dining room was full of people eating breakfast.

“What are we waiting for?”

“The deer.”

Drathalion’s ear pricked. A pale green half-orc sat a table with 3 other members, one of whom was another pale green half-orc.

“Who is this deer anyway?” The second half-orc asked.

The first half-orc sighed. “He’s a friend.”

“So where is he?” A yellow dragonborn took an angry sip from his mug.

“I’ve been calling for him, but since what happened last night, he hasn’t answered any of my calls.” The first half-orc said.

“We can wait for him for a little while longer, see if he shows.” The second half-orc said.

“I can’t believe he’s been keeping us waiting this long.” The dragonborn grumbled.

Drathalion pulled her hood further over her face. She sat on a bar stool at the counter.

“How can I help you?” The dwarf behind the counter asked.

“I’ll have a berry… omelet.” Drathalion leaned in.

The dwarf looked puzzled. “We don’t have that.”

“It’s a flat food, golden brown, with blueberries.”

“Pancake.” The half-orc came to the bar.

“Yes, blueberry pancakes.” Drathalion tossed some coins on the counter.

“I’ll get you a full stack. And you sir?” The dwarf turned to the half-orc.

“Just a question. Have you seen the old man today?”

“That beggar on the front porch? Thankfully, not today.”

“Ok, thanks.” The half-orc returned to his table.

Soon, the dwarf brought out the pancakes, and Drathalion ate them.

Then the tavern doors burst open, and an exasperated bird person hobbled in. It spoke in tweets and caws, seemingly at the whole tavern. It looked around, its eyes landing on the party with the half-orc. It squeaked and cawed frantically, as if it was trying to tell them something, waving a letter around, written in a foreign script.

“Anyone know what this guy is saying?” The half-orc asked.

“No, Gra, I don’t.” The second half-orc shrugged.

“I’m sorry, we don’t understand.” Gra tried to shoo the bird person away.

Drathalion’s eyes lit up. She approached the table. “I have flown a great distance to deliver this letter.” She held a hand to her perked ear.

The party turned to her and listened. The bird person cheered and continued its message.

“I need to find one named Revali. He should be in the aarakocra village of Wind’s Crossing. I need to deliver this letter to him.”

The aarakocra squawked and smiled at Gra, holding out the letter.

“Will you take this to him? I’ll give you 200 gold.” Drathalion changed tone. “Oh! Negotiate for 300!”

Gra held up 3 fingers. “3 gold?”

The aarkocra eagerly nodded, and held up 3 feathers. He pulled out a pouch and cawed.

“Does this look right?”

Gra held the coin pouch in his hand, tossing it in the air. The coins came down with a satisfying *clink-clink*. “Yeah this should do.” He nodded and shook the aarakocra’s feathered hand.

He tweeted.

“Thank you. Happy flights!”

The aarakocra left.

“Thanks for translating.” Gra addressed Drathalion. “That was very helpful.”

Drathalion bowed. “My pleasure.”

“Where we’re going, we’re going to need a translator. Mind tagging along?”

“I’d be delighted to.”

Gra stuck his hand out to shake.

Drathalion hesitated, but then offered her right hand too. When it came out of the sleeve, the cast was clearly visible. It covered her palm and stretched up to her elbow.

Gra shook it carefully. “What happened to you?”

Drathalion shrugged. “Got in a fight. You should’ve seen the other creature.”

“What did you do?”

“I’m an archer, like Sui here. I shot it in the face, and it died. Put simply.”

“Well it sounds like I can count on you in a fight, I like that.” Gra emptied the gold onto the table and split it into 5 piles, one for each party member, including Drathalion.

Each one grabbed their share of gold, but Drathalion’s share slid to her across the table, falling off the ledge into her bag below.

Gra also handed the letter to the other pale-green half-orc. “Keep this safe.”

“Of course, Gra.”

The party introduced themselves: Gra the half-orc, Sui the dragonborn, Gale the Yinglet, and Gra the half-orc (the second one).

“Before we get going,” Drathalion warned. “We have to stop and get some winter clothing. There’s a shop along the way, I’ll show you. Do you have the map?”

“How do you know I have a map?” Gra took it out.

“I assumed the aarakocra gave you one?”

Gra eyed her. “I have it.” He placed it on the table.

Drathalion took out a pen and marked a dot on the map. “It’s here. Let’s go.” She stood up.

Gra pushed her back into her seat. “No we have to wait for the deer.”

Drathalion looked to the side, then pointed out the window. “What’s that old man doing out there?”

“Old man?” Gra turned. He got out of his chair and went out to the porch, looking for the old man.

The old man in shaggy clothes with a tin can was in his usual spot, but this time he was dancing like a mad man.

“Astalir, it’s good to see you.”

The old man turned to Gra, gave a thumbs up, then ran around the side of the building.

Gra followed, but he didn’t find any trace of him. He sighed, leaning on his knees. “Back to your old tricks, huh?” He stood back up. “Ok, I’ll take that as the sign.”

Gra gathered the party members up, and they set off towards Wind’s Crossing.

“That was most informative.” Don JeLancie rubbed his hands together, still looking through the fly-eyed goggles. “They’ll be here soon. This’ll be quite fun.” He chuckled to himself.

“Um, hello?”

Don lifted his fly-eyed goggles. A customer stood before him.

He was wearing green sleeves and leggings, a brown vest, and a green hat with a feather.

“Ah, yes, how can I help you?”

“My grandma is getting really old, and we fear for her health.”

“Ah, I have just the thing!” Don reached under the counter and pulled out a health potion. “One moment please.” Don entered his wagon and shut the door behind him. He held the potion in one hand and snapped his fingers with the other. A brilliant flash of light appeared for a brief moment, and when it was gone, the potion sparkled and was extra bubbly. Don emerged from his wagon and presented the potion to the customer. “This potion is what you need, mister…?”

“Robin Hood.”

“Mr. Robin Hood. This is the potion you need.”

“What does it do?”

“Just have her drink this and she’ll get better in no time.”

“Thank you!” Robin Hood took the potion.

But Don held it back. “That’ll be 1700 gold.”

“Oh, of course.” Robin Hood pulled a bag from his belt and tossed it on the counter. “That should be enough.”

Don counted real quick. “My, my. There’s only 1500 gold here.”

“Will you accept 1500 gold?”

“Hmm…” Don thought. “No. The price is still 1725 gold.”

“You just increased the price!”

“No, the price has always been 17*50* gold.” Don smugly smiled.

Robin Hood became cross. “I see what you’re doing, and I don’t like it. But I’ll get you that 1750 gold.” He stormed off.

“Hagglers.” Don muttered as he put his fly-eyed goggles back on and leaned back in his chair. Drathalion and her party were still on their way to his shop.

==================

It wasn’t long before they arrived.

“Greetings! Welcome to Don JeLancie’s Department of Joy. What can I do for you?”

Gra looked over the items displayed on the counter. “Do you have any winter attire?”

“That I do, my friend.” Don pulled a winter coat out from under the counter. “This will keep you warm even in the coldest of places. It comes with gloves, leggings, and hat included.”

“That’s great!” Gra took the coat, inspecting it. “We’ll take 5.”

“Ok, that’ll be 100 gold.”

“100 gold each?!” Sui yelled. “Stop ripping us off!” Sui grabbed Don’s coat and attempted to lift him up.

A bell on Don’s chest rang. With a flash of light, Sui was shrunk down to the size of a coconut. Don caught him in his palm. “You shouldn’t have done that.”

=== THIS SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR REWRITING ===

“Put me down!”

“Not until you apologize.”

“Eh! Eh!” Sui loaded his bow and shot a tiny arrow at Don, which bounced uselessly off his clothes.

“Here, I got him.” Gra put his hands out, and Don dropped Sui into his hands. “Sorry for my associate’s aggressive behaviour.”

“Not a problem, as long as you keep him in check.”

“So, about those coats, 90 gold for all 5?”

“The price is still 125 for all 5.”

“But you said it was 100 before.”

“No, I always said it was 150 for all 5.”

Gra stared at him, dismayed. “I’ve got a feeling you’re not being honest with me.”

“Look, can you just lower the price back to 100 gold?” Other Gra butted in.

“No, I will not lower the price below 175.”

Other Gra stood next to the counter, and Don’s jacket scrunched up and he floated into the air. “Look, we just want the jackets. Don’t punish us for our dragonborn’s mistake. We don’t listen to him anyways.”

Don felt around his stomache. His hands couldn’t quite touch his ribs. “Ooh! This is interesting. But yes, you have a point. I will give you a 75 gold discount.”

“That’s not what I—”

Gra laid his hand on Other Gra, cutting him off. “That’s very gracious of you, thank you.”

Other Gra relaxed and Don floated back to the ground.

“I’m glad we could settle that. But, you still broke the rules.” The bell rang and a light flashed. “Perhaps you will learn to keep your hands off me.”

“Are you ok?” Gra asked Other Gra.

Other Gra rubbed his stomach and drooled from his mouth. “Bagels.”

Drathalion took advantage of the commotion. Eying a particular coat with bubbly features, she snatched it.

“Nuh uh uh.” Don’s bell rang and a light flashed.

Drathalion dropped the bubble coat on the ground. Her fingers hung in a neutral position. She stared at them. “I can’t feel my hands!”

“Well that’s what you get for trying to steal.”

She tried moving her fingers, but they only twitched.

Gra settled down. “I’m sorry for my associate.” He eyed Drathalion. “But can we continue with the purchase?”

“Yes. Let’s.”

“Let get out my 100 gold.” Gra rummaged around in his bag of holding.

Tiny Sui peeked in. “You got the deck of random oddities in there?”

Other Gra caught Sui. “Are you a bagel?”

“No! Put me down!” Sui protested.

“Ok, so you said 100 gold *total* for the 5 coats?” Gra counted out the gold.

“Yes, that is correct.”

Gra and Don exchanged gold for coats. Gra went to hand each member a coat, but found it difficult to. One was too small to hold it, one was a tiger, and one was too busy craving bagels to think about coats. Except Dog Drathalion: she had gotten over her sudden transformation and was thinking.

“Coat?” Gra handed it to her.

“Thanks.” Dog Drathalion accepted it. “Can I borrow 200 gold?”

“What? No. I barely know you.”

“Well I am your guide and translator, consider it a prepayment for my services.”

“Well we don’t need a guide. I have this map.” Gra pulled it out of his bag. “Besides, what do you need 200 gold for?”

“There’s this item I want to buy. With it, I’ll be able to keep us safe.”

“Ok, what does it do?”

“It lets me fly.”

“Just you? How about us?”

“Well, no, just me. But if I can fly, I can carry you one person at a time anywhere.”

“Hmm… no.”

“It’ll be very useful for protection.”

“I don’t think we’ll need to worry about that. We have a secret weapon.” Gra crossed his arms.

“Secret weapon?” Dog Drathalion cocked her head.

“Yes, whenever we get in trouble, something comes in and keeps us safe.”

“Would this secret weapon happen to be a dear friend of yours?”

“Deer friend? No, no one said anything about a deer.”

Dog Drathalion squinted. “I’ve heard rumors that this friend of yours had a very bad accident and is out of commission.”

“How would you know?” Gra stared into Dog Drathalion’s eyes. If this was one of Astalir’s illusions, he would know it. But no, Dog Drathalion did not fade or go transparent. “Huh?” Gra stewed. He looked away.

“Ok, how about 50 gold?”

“50 gold? Ok.” Gra gave it to Dog Drathalion.

“Thank you.”

“Gra?” Other Gra was worried.

“Yes, Gra?”

“Don’t look now, but there’s a tiger right beside us.”

“Oh, don’t worry about him, he’s a party member.”

“We have a tiger in our party?”

“Yes.”

“Does he have bagels?”

“This one, unfortunately does not.” Tiger Gale responded.

“He speaks!” Other Gra exclaimed.

“Yes, he is a speaking tiger.” Gra confirmed.

“What is his name?”

“This one’s name is Gale.”

“Gale? I think I know a kangaroo named Gale.”

“Yinglet, but yes.” Tiger Gale corrected.

“Wow, what a coincidence! You’ve got to meet my friend Gale, Gale. I think you two would get along famously.”

“This one would be delighted.”

“Gale?”

“Yes?”

“Do you have any bagels?”

“This one does not, but would like some.”

“I’ve got bagels!” Dog Drathalion pulled some bagels out of her coat. She held one out to Other Gra.

“Yay!” Other Gra grabbed at it, but Dog Drathalion swiped it away.

“50 gold.” She waved it in his face.

“Uh!” Other Gra whined. “I want it, but 50 gold? That’s a bit steep, don’t you think?”

“Stop ripping us off!” Sui yelled helplessly from Other Gra’s palm.

“Shush, shush.” Other Gra put a finger over Sui’s mouth. “Here’s 50 gold.”

“Thank you.” Dog Drathalion gave the bagel to Other Gra.

“What is this? It’s got blue dots all in inside it.”

“Those are blueberries. They’re blueberry bagels.”

“Blueberries, huh? How do they taste?”

“Like… blue?”

“Ok.” Other Gra took a bite. He looked disgusted. “This… doesn’t taste… like bagels.”

“It’s a new flavor. A bit experimental.” Dog Drathalion encouraged. “Just keep chewing, it’ll get better.”

“If you say so.” Other Gra munched a bit more. “No, this definitely doesn’t taste like… wait! Pancakes?” Other Gra swallowed. “It tastes like pancakes!”

Dog Drathalion nodded. “Yes, it’s blueberry pancake flavor. It’s a new bagel flavor.”

“What a weird flavor.”

“Can this one try?” Tiger Gale opened his mouth.

“Sure. That’ll be 50 gold.”

“Ok.” Tiger Gale agreed.

Dog Drathalion pulled out another bagel and tossed it at Tiger Gale. She missed, and the bagel landed on Tiger Gale’s back.

“Oh. I can’t reach it.”

“I got it.” Gra went to grab the bagel, but stopped. Upon closer inspection, it interacted weirdly with Tiger Gale’s tiger fur. Fur was depressed where the bagel hole was supposed to be. He tried sticking his finger in the bagel hole, but felt something soft and squishy that definitely wasn’t tiger fur. He stared intently at it, and it faded away. Beneath the bagel was a blueberry pancake. “Odd.” He picked it up and plopped it into Tiger Gale’s mouth. “Here you go.”

“Thanks.” Tiger Gale munched it happily.

“No problem.” Gra rubbed Tiger Gale’s head. “Wow, your fur is so soft!”

“Let me try!” Other Gra rubbed Tiger Gale’s shoulders. “Wow, it is!”

Gra and Other Gra pet Tiger Gale all over: on the head, behind the ears, the shoulders, along the back, and on the chest.

“This one likes this.” Tiger Gale smiled as he leaned into the pets.

Dog Drathalion approached the counter. “I’ve got enough for the bubble coat now.” She placed the gold on the counter.

“Ah, but your attempt at a five-finger discount is going to cost you… um, 25 gold.

Dog Drathalion rolled her eyes, but put an extra 25 gold on the counter.

“Ah, yes, very nice.” Don collected the gold. “Here is your bubble coat, which lets you go in the air.”

“Thank you. How do I activate it?” Dog Drathalion took the coat.

“I think you’ll find it quite intuitive.”

“But—”

“Good day.” Don nodded at her, clearly trying to get her to go away. “It has been much fun watching you all react to your changes, but I hope you’ve learned your lesson?”

Gra nodded. “We will not attempt to aggress you again, Mr. JeLancie.”

“Very well. I accept your apology.”

“Now will you turn us back to normal?”

“No, but worry not. Your changes will automatically revert in 1 hour.” Don assured.

“Ok.” Gra motioned to the party. “Let’s go.”

“Would you like to rent a cart with horses? It’s a long travel.” Don held out an ad.

“No, we can walk.” Gra waved him off.

=== END REWRITING CONSTRUCTION ZONE ===

The party left. Gra led the way with his map, followed closely by Dog Drathalion. Other Gra held tiny Sui in one hand, and Tiger Gale’s furry shoulders in the other.

Don JeLancie looked on with a huge smile. He chuckled as he donned his fly-eyed goggles again. “That was quite fun. Indeed, this ‘Drathalion Treescorn’ is going to make one lovely guinea pig. Or maybe her companions would be more fun. We shall see…” Don snapped his fingers and he and his cart faded away, leaving an empty lot where it was once sitting.

The party ventured along the trail. Before the hour was up, they trekked into a deep dark forest. Crickets and birds chirped and trilled. Up ahead, Gra spotted a lone man wearing green clothes and hat.

“Hey, that’s Robin Hood!” Gra pointed him out.

“Is he dangerous?" Dog Drathalion asked.

“He steals from the rich and gives to the poor.”

“Rich? I just got 1000 gold from the cards last night.” Sui admitted. “Does that make me rich?”

“I don’t know.” Gra shrugged. “That’s for Robin Hood and his merry men to decide.”

“Merry men?” Dog Drathalion’s eyes darted around, looking for anyone hiding.

“Yeah,” Gra said. “Robin Hood’s band of guys who help he achieve his heists. Good people.”

“Are they here?” Dog Drathalion drew her bow.

“It’s ok.” Gra pointed her bow down. “We don’t want to fight. Don’s curses, remember?” Gra pinched his skin again, showing that it still bleeds.

“Right.” Dog Drathalion put her bow away.

The party approached Robin Hood.

“Hello, I am Robin Hood. And who might you be?”

Gra introduced the party to Robin Hood.

“You seem like good people.” He greeted. “Where are you headed?”

“We’re delivering a letter.”

“To where?”

“The mountains.” Gra waved the map.

“Ah, yes, those mountains. They’re right down this trail to the left. It’s not hard. But before you go, I have a favor to ask.”

Gra put the map away. “Yes?”

“Would you perhaps have any change to spare? I need help with a loved one who is sick.”

“How much do you need?” Gra asked.

“200 gold should be fine.” Robin Hood said.

“Ok, let me see.” Gra rummaged around in his bag of holding.

Dog Drathalion’s ears twitched. “I don’t like this.” She secretly picked up some rocks and put them in a bag. She held them to Robin Hood. “Here’s around 200 to 300 gold.” She opened the bag. Gold coins sparkled in the light that pierced through the treetops. “Gra, confirm?” She tossed the bag at Gra.

Gra tossed the bag in the air and let it land in his palm. “Feels like it weighs about… like it’s about 250 gold.” He pulled the drawstring shut and handed it to Robin Hood.

Robin Hood took it eagerly. “Thank you so much! This is going to help a lot. You may now pass.”

Dog Drathalion fake smiled and nodded.

The party walked passed.

Dog Drathalion whispered to Gra, “When we get out of range, run.”

Gra agreed. “Ok.”

When they got 90 feet away, Gra sprinted ahead. Dog Drathalion sprinted behind him, and the rest of the party followed suit. A mile later, they stopped.

“Why are we running?” Other Gra asked.

“Let’s just say that wasn’t a bag of gold.” Dog Drathalion answered.

“Rocks?”

“Yeah, how’d you know?”

“…Lucky guess.”

The party ventured onward, and eventually reverted back to normal. Sui returned to normal size, but still had to wrestle himself out of Other Gra’s grip. Other Gra no longer craved bagels, and Gra’s skin returned to normal.

Dog Drathalion noticed the changes reverting and ran into the forest alone. She cowered in her cloak as she transformed back into her old self. Her hood stretched up to over twice her head size, her tail shortened, and her voice changed. Then with a flickering spark, she returned to her normal self. She emerged from the woods once again a cat.

Oh, and Tiger Gale transformed back into yinglet Gale.

“This one still wants pets though.”

“Of course!” Other Gra scritched him behind the ears.

The party ventured onward. They ventured mostly uneventfully through the forest. Along the way, Drathalion spotted a rabbit. She blinked and a blue paw print appeared on the rabbit. She drew her bow and shot at it. She missed and the rabbit ran off, taking the blue glowing pawprint with it, until it was out of range.

When they got a few miles from the mountains, they came across a shop on the side of the road. It was run by a lizardfolk and served mostly fresh meats. “What can I get for you today?”

“Do you have any clams?” Gale asked.

“Yes I do.” The lizardfolk said.

“You should get that checked out.” Other Gra retorted.

“No, you’re thinking of crabs.” Gra corrected.

“This one will have *clams*. Just the clams.”

“Here you go.” The lizardfolk gave Gale a bowl of clams.

Other Gra stepped to the counter. “I would like some bagels. And they better not be pancakes.”

“Why would they be pancakes?” The lizardfolk asked quizzically.

“I got ripped off last time.”

“Ok, would you like it toasted or buttered?”

“Both.”

The lizardfolk made a bagel for Other Gra and handed it to him.

“And what about for you?” The lizardfolk asked Gra.

“I’ll have…” Gra looked directly at Drathalion. “Venison.”

Drathalion scowled.

“Oh! Me too!” Other Gra chimed in.

Drathalion grumbled and pulled her hood over her face.

“Would you also like venison?” The lizardfolk asked Drathalion.

Drathalion put a hand over her mouth like she was trying to keep from puking. She turned around and ran to the other side of the path. There, she stepped on a strange twig and a hole opened up beneath her. She twisted around and managed to grab the edge of the pit. Gra casually walked over to check on her.

The lizardfolk listened in on their conversation.

“What’s wrong, Drathalion?” Gra grabbed her good hand and pulled her out of the pit.

She dusted herself off at the top of the pit.

“Do you not like venison? Or is there some other reason…” Gra got right up in her face. “…Astalir?”

Drathalion panicked and waved her arms in front of her. “It’s not me! It’s not me!”

Gra gave a slight nod. “Ok, I’m with you. Drathalion.”

Drathalion calmed down. “Thank you.”

The lizardfolk gave the party some food, and then the party left. As they walked away, the lizardfolk food wagon faded away.

=============

And then Don JeLancie’s Department of Joy faded in. And he already had a customer.

“I got the 1700 gold!” Robin Hood exclaimed, pouring coins out of bags on the counter. So far so good, a huge pile of gold. Then he poured out the last bag. A bunch of rocks came tumbling out. “What?”

“Nice try,” smirked Don. “But I don’t accept merrymen currency.”

“Merrymen? No, this was supposed to be gold. I got it from that dog person with the pet tiger.”

“Ah, the dog person, yes.” Don chuckled.

“I can’t believe they tricked me like this! Even after knowing I needed it to help my sick grandma!”

Don smiled evilly. “You must be so upset.”

“Indeed I am!” Robin Hood kicked a rock.

“Well, it’s also unfortunate that you tried to offer me counterfeit change, which is against the rules.”

“What are you going to do?”

“A test.” Don’s bell rang and a flash of light struck Robin Hood.

“AAARGGH!” Robin Hood’s silhouette grew twice as large as his legs and torso stretched to the sky.

“How delightful!” Don exclaimed at his new creation. “Now, Robin Hood, you have about an hour to enact your revenge.” Don reached under the table and produced a compass. “Oh! And here is something to help you find them.” He handed the compass to Robin Hood. It had a picture of Drathalion behind the needle. “Have fun!”

Robin Hood stomped off down the path.

===========

Hours later, the party found a nice place next to a river. Gra started a campfire and Other Gra started a conversation.

“These people are trustworthy, right?” Other Gra whispered to Gra.

“Yeah, I think so.”

“None play tricks on us?”

“Well…” Gra poked the fire. “None more than usual, and none maliciously.”

“Good enough for me.” Other Gra turned to Gale. “Hey Gale, what would you do if you saw a mythical creature?”

“It would be delightful, maybe.” Gale sat next to Other Gra, petitioning him for pets. “This one holds no grudge against any creature.”

“You have grudges?”

“This one only wishes to kill the undead.”

“Understandable.” Other Gra stroked Gale’s head and under his chin. “What about you, cat?”

“Me?” Drathalion leaned up against a tree. “I would run away.”

“What are you? A scaredy cat?”

“I mean… run away to get in optimal shooting range. I am a ranger, after all.”

“Ah, I see…”

Gra pushed a twig back into the fire. “I would befriend it.” He looked at Drathalion.

Drathalion smiled back.

Gra groaned.

“You ok?” Drathalion asked.

Gra held his head. “Yeah, I just got a splitting headache. Something probably took the chance and got through my skin when it was thin.”

“Well you know the one way to stop it, right?” Other Gra continued petting Gale.

“What’s that?” Gra looked at him.

Other Gra smiled. “Step on a sharp rock. That way you feel the pain of the rock more than your headache.”

“Good one.” Gra looked down.

“Speaking of which, I have to go.” Other Gra got up.

“And find a sharp rock?” Drathalion snarked.

“Yeah, so I can piss on it.” Other Gra walked away.

“Ah, I gotcha.” Gra let Other Gra go.

Other Gra went deeper into the forest, out of sight of the party.

Gale scooched up next to Gra, asking for pets. As Gra obliged, Gale smiled.

“Want to draw a card?” Gra asked.

“Sure.” Gale drew one, and a top hat appeared on his head. “This one feels fancy.”

“Wow, that’s a nice hat.”

“Thanks! More pets?”

“Sorry, I can’t pet your head when there’s a hat on it.”

“This one laments getting hat.”

Out of the bushes, something came through. It wasn’t Other Gra, but a little girl.

“Who is that one?” Gale pointed.

“Her? She’s been with us this entire time.” Gra stated.

“I don’t remember them.” Drathalion looked puzzled.

“They’ve been, here, this entire, time.” Gra winked at her.

“Oh!” Drathalion’s eyes lit up. “Right! Yes, they *have* been here this whole time!”

Gra nodded.

Gale stared at her. “What?”

“Can you remind me your name?” Drathalion asked.

“You forgot already?” The girl asked.

“My memory is bad.”

“This one confuse. This one Gra?”

“No I’m Gra.”

“But she Gra, too.” Gale pointed.

“No, she’s Reesu.” Gra said.

“What?” Gale was getting flustered. “Come pet this one now. This one will find truth instantly.”

Reesu sat next to Gale. Her hands hovered above his head, and Gale’s fur bent and swayed like he was being petted.

“Ah yes! She pet like Gra. This one Gra. No no Reesu, two Gras.”

Gra crossed his arms. “She was with us at the battle with the owlbear.”

“No, this one remembers two gras.” Gale gave in to the pets. “Ok, ok. As long as you give good pets, this one no question.”

“Maybe you’ll remember me tomorrow.” Reesu pet Gale as his eyes got heavy.

“Sleep on it.” Gra agreed.

“This one will go to sleep, yes, and then….” Gale fell asleep, head resting in Reesu’s lap.

Drathalion sat next to Reesu and whispered to her. “How do you do that?”

“It’s easy,” Reesu explained. “Just pet him very gently and he’ll go right to sleep.”

“No, not that. How do you change your voice?”

Reesu laughed. “I can’t change my voice.”

Drathalion stared at her. “Hmm… ok. Do you know who I am?”

“You’re a cat.”

“Yes, good.” Drathalion motioned to Gra. “I need a word with you.” She led him to a tree that blocked the party’s sight of her.

Gra accompanied her.

Drathalion disappeared, and underneath, a deer took her place. The deer got down on all fours, then lifted its front right leg up. It had a cast on it that had been wrapped by a friend who had affectionately written “\<3 Jodi”. The deer breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you.”

“Astalir!” Gra whispered. He petted the top of his head. “You’re speaking with me, that’s new, and very welcomed. How are you holding up?”

“Healing is slow; it’s scarred.” He pumped his casted leg. “Can I see the map?”

Gra took it out and it floated over to Astalir. A ink quill floated out of his fur and pinned the map against a tree. The quill drew an angry face in the forest where they encountered Robin Hood. Then the quill flew back into Astalir’s fur, and the map floated back into Gra’s hand.

“You don’t want to run into Robin Hood again?” Gra lightly chuckled.

“I don’t think he’d be pleased to run into us again either.”

“Speaking of sharing the wealth, here’s your cut.” Gra handed him a bag with 200 gold. “This is for the kobold quest.”

“Thanks, but I didn’t actually help you with it.”

Gra shrugged. “Eh, ok, think of it as a thank you for saving our butts from the bears.” Gra sat down against the tree.

Astalir laughed. “Ok, that works. By the way, here’s your 50 gold back.” Astalir floated 50 gold into Gra’s hands as he laid down next to Gra. He rested his head against the corner where Gra and the tree met.

“Thanks.”

“Hey, Gra?”

“Yeah?”

“I can’t… I can’t…”

“It’s ok, Astalir, you can trust me.”

“I can’t sleep.”

“Why not?”

“If I go to sleep, I lose my disguise. I don’t trust the party to know that I’m actually Astalir.”

“I’m sure it’ll be ok…”

“I don’t trust them.”

“Ok, it’s ok, Astalir.” Gra patted him on the head. “I’ll stand guard for you, make sure they don’t see you.”

“Thank you.”

“I can’t sleep either, Astalir.”

“Paranoia too?”

“Just got a cup of coffee with that keeps me up.”

“Must’ve been one strong cup.”

“Yeah, it was.” Gra patted his back. “You go on to sleep now. I’ll keep you safe.”

“Thanks, Gra.”

“Sleep well, buddy.”

========================

Don JeLancie clasped his hands enthusiastically. He was still viewing Astalir through the fly-eyed goggles. “Oh ho ho! This’ll be quite entertaining! I can’t wait for Robin Hood to get there!”

# Chapter 8 – Robin Hood

“I can’t believe they gave me fake change!” Robin Hood stomped along the path towards Drathalion’s location. His merry men followed closely behind him. “I’m going to make them pay! In gold, this time!”

“Don’t worry honey, we’ll get payback from them!” His grandma consoled. She brandished two poison-tipped daggers in her hands.

“Thanks, Grandma Marigold.”

Robin Hood, his grandma, his merry men, and his grandma’s goons hunted down Drathalion using the compass Don gave him.

Robin Hood’s unusually long, slender legs gave him the impression of using stilts. But no, this was Don’s doing. Robin Hood had to make good use of this while he could, although he wasn’t comfortable fighting in this state.

“My knees feel way too vulnerable.”

Finally they caught up to Drathalion and her party. They were making camp and talking to each other. Robin Hood stood behind a large tree and observed the camp from his tall height, waiting for an opportune time to strike.

Drathalion the cat talked with a pale green half-orc alone by a tree. Even in the dark, Robin Hood could see them with his temporary dark vision eyes, which also gave him 20/20 vision, even at this far range.

The cat turned into a deer, which was surprising, but not enough to deter Robin Hood. The half-orc gave Drathalion a bag of gold, and this bag looked to be full of actual gold.

“Perfect! That’s just what I need.” He reached down and tapped his grandma on the head. “Go.”

Grandma Marigold snuck through the bushes until she was in pouncing range of the half-orc. With a coordinated effort from some fellow bandits, she jumped out of the bush and held a knife to the half-orc’s neck. Another bandit held a fully charged arrow shot to the deer’s face.

“Give us the gold, and no one gets hurt.” Grandma Marigold snarled. “And don’t you even think about yelling for help.” She pressed the knife a little harder up against his neck.

“Sure, let me get that for you.” The half-orc slowly reached into his bag of holding. “I know I have it in here somewhere.”

The deer didn’t say anything, but dumped his backpack on the ground. All sorts of items came pouring out, but a bag of gold was not one of them.

Meanwhile, Robin Hood was directing his other bandits to surround the entire party. A dwarf bandit snuck up on the tiny kangaroo, who was sleeping on a rock. Several bandits set up behind trees, bows aimed at the dragonborn. Several more archers took aim at the half-orc and deer.

The pale-orc took his sweet time producing the gold as his eyes dart left and right, assessing the situation. “Oh! Here it is! Here you GO!” The pale-orc drew out a battle axe from his bag of holding and swiped at Marigold.

Marigold’s armor protected her from the attack, but she staggered backward into the bush.

The other bandits all fired, starting confrontations all over the camp.

The archer shot the deer in the face, but the arrow slowed down considerably, only getting stuck in the deer’s nose. The deer then transformed back into the cat and climbed the tree, knifing a bandit or two that tried to grab it as it went up. The cat pointed at a bandit, and a blue pawprint appeared on his chest. The cat landed an arrow in the bandit, hitting it right on the pawprint. The bandit fell over, dead, and the pawprint moved to a new target.

Bandits surrounded the half-orc, who swung his axe in a circle, beheading two bandits in one swing. The cat shot a bandit in the back, and the half-orc plowed his blade into his chest.

The dragonborn took one shot to the back, but seemed unphased. The bandits swarmed him with daggers. So he reached into his pocket and pulled out a potion of green liquid.

“That’s not what I think it is?” Robin Hood’s mouth dropped.

The dragonborn took a swig of the green liquid and then splashed the bottle on the ground, which shattered and splashed its contents everywhere.

The bandits cried in pain as their clothes, skin, and flesh dissolved before their eyes, which also dissolved. The dragonborn, on the other hand, was completely unscathed, and in fact, seemed to have healed all the arrow wounds.

“He must be an acid dragon.” Robin Hood commented to himself. “We’ll have to outrange him.”

The archer bandits shot arrows at him, several of them hitting. One hit him in the neck.

The dragonborn didn’t fall. He removed the arrow from his neck, put it in his dragonbow, and then took aim at two of the archers who shot him. “Wanna try that again?” He let the arrow loose, and it whizzed by the closer archer, slicing his ear in half. That archer and the one next to him dropped their bows and ran off.

“That guy’s tough. We’re going to need more man power to take him down.” Robin Hood turned his attention to the sleeping kangaroo. “Ah, this should be easy!”

The kangaroo slept on a rock near the river bank. He lay in a rather awakward-looking position. A sneaky bandit snuck up on him as he slept. The bandit drew his dagger and plunged it into the kang—

The kangaroo rolled over in his sleep, just as the bandit was about to stab him, causing the dagger to get stuck in the rock.

The bandit kept his cool, and got his bow out instead. From point-blank range, he shot the kang—

He missed. The arrow went right over the kangaroo’s head, and into the campfire, where it promptly burned up.

Robin Hood gasped. “He’s asleep! How did you miss??”

A small woman crossed the river behind the bandit. She tapped him on the shoulder, and then as soon as he turned around, she let out a shockwave and disappeared. That shockwave disintegrated the bandit, splashing his blood all over the kangaroo and his rock. The small woman ended up right behind Marigold.

Grandma Marigold was battling the half-orc. True to her skill, she was dodging battle axe swings and cat arrows, using her armor as a useful defensive tool.

“Go Grandma Marigold! Get him!”

Grandma Marigold took advantage of the half-orc’s openings and plunged her poison-tipped dagger into his shoulder, his belly, and his ribs. He was tough, but little by little, she was wearing him down.

“Just like she wears me down with her nagging,” Robin Hood chuckled.

The half-orc swung his axe at Grandma Marigold, but she blocked it with her dagger. A blue pawprint appeared on her chest, and she reacted by directing the axe blade in front of her, blocking an arrow from the tree. She slid past the axe and stabbed the half-orc in the gut. Green and red oozed out of his wounds.

The half-orc yelled in pain, and his eyes became bloodshot. He swung his axe wildly, forcing Grandma Marigold to back away. She dodged nimbly, but couldn’t find an opening to attack.

And that’s when the small woman boomed across the battlefield, appearing in a dazzling flash of lightning right behind Marigold. She cut her off, and before she could dodge, Grandma Marigold was lifted up into the air.

Grandma Marigold struggled as she rose. She stabbed at the air, but her arms got pulled to her side before she could free herself.

“Grandma Marigold!” Robin Hood slid out from behind the tall tree and stepped over some smaller trees. “I’m coming!”

But before he could get there, he watched over the treetops as the small woman smiled evilly. Grandma Marigold dropped her dagger as she leaned forward. Her face crept closer and closer to her feet, until—

*SNAP*

The sound of bones cracking sent a chill down Robin Hood’s back. Grandma Marigold’s lower back burst open as her spine snapped in two. Her cold, dead eyes hung on her face as she plopped to the ground.

“Oops.” The small woman giggled. “Guess I’m stronger than I realized.”

“You killed my grandma!” Robin Hood lifted a foot high above the small woman’s head and stepped down onto her.

“Oh look! I found a foot!”

Robin Hood’s foot slammed into the ground faster than he had anticipated. He went to lift it back up, but it was stuck on the ground. He tried to lift his other one.

“I found another one!”

“What? What is this?” Robin Hood yelled down from his stilts-for-legs vantage point.

“Oh! They’re yours!” The small woman shouted.

“Let me go!”

“No, I don’t think I will.”

“I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you all!”

“Not if I kill you first!” The half-orc, still red-eyed, swung his axe into Robin Hood’s ankles, slicing them to the point of uselessness.

A blue pawprint appeared on Robin Hood’s chest, and an arrow followed soon after.

Robin Hood was taking a beating, but thanks to his larger size, he was also more durable. But it still hurt. “Oh merry men!”

A whole dozen bandits appeared out from behind the trees.

“Attack!”

The bandits charged toward the group, yelling at the top of their lungs.

“Incoming!” The dragonborn threw a green potion at the bandits. It was another acid potion!

Before it could splash down, the small lady spit into the air, and then flicked a glowing finger at it, flinging the magic spit wad at the acid potion. The acid potion exploded mid-air above the bandits! And the magic spit wad became a deluge of water, raining down on the bandits.

The bandits screamed as their clothes melted off their skin, their skin melted off their flesh, and their flesh melted off their bones. When the acid rain finally stopped, the bandits were nothing more than a pile of bones and weapons.

“I knew I should have hired that necromancer!” Robin Hood cursed. He knelt down to punch the small lady into the ground.

But the half-orc swung his battle axe into his fingers, chopping them off. He swung at his legs even more, making it harder for him to keep his balance.

Finally, an arrow shot right through his larger-than-normal skull.

“Ughhhhh…” Robin Hood groaned as he lost consciousness. He fell to the ground.

*THTHTHUUUDDD!*

The ground shook as he landed. At the same time, his hour expired. He shrank back down to his normal size, spewing blood from his mouth as he went down.

===========

“I claim his head!” Reesu stood next to his neck. It stretched, tearing itself apart. The head popped off, taking the spine with it. Blood and veins spilled out of the neck wound.

“Your bad habits are rearing up again.” Gra scolded.

“What? You don’t want to do this too?” Reesu gleefully held up the head, making the jaw move as she spoke. “Come and rip me apart, Gra. It’s fun! Come on Gra!” Then she tossed the head to Gra.

It bounced in Gra’s hands for a bit before he tossed it back. “Keep it to yourself, Reesu.”

“Hmm… now I need a place to store it. Gra?”

“Reesu, no.” He held onto his bag of holding.

“Come on.” Reesu grappled Gra to get to his bag of holding, but he clenched his fist tight around the bag, so she couldn’t grab it.

“Reesu.”

“Ok…” Reesu let go.

Then the yinglet approached. “What is happen? Why this one covered in blood?”

“You didn’t see?”

“This one just woke up.”

“Wow, you’re a heavy sleeper.” Gra commented.

Reesu took advantage of the momentary distraction to slip Robin Hood’s head into Gra’s bag of holding. He didn’t notice. Then she skipped around the acid-splashed bones and picked up all the gold pieces she could find.

Gra knelt down in pain.

“That one ok?”

“I’m fine, just need to walk it off.”

“This one heals you.” Gale laid a paw on Gra, glowing the pain away as the green ooze boiled away and his wounds closed.

“Thanks.”

“Oh ho ho!” A voice rang out, seemingly from nowhere. A slow clap followed.

The party looked around, but no one was there.

“That was quite entertaining, far exceeding my expectations.” Out of a flash of light, Don JeLancie appeared.

“What are you doing here?” Sui asked.

“Nothing, nothing at all. I’m just here to thank you for taking care of that rapscallion Robin Hood. I couldn’t stand that fellow.”

“Yeah, he was bothering us too.” Gra wiped the blood from his axe.

“Say, how about a discount on store merchandise? The least I can do for you after such help.” Don snapped his finger and his cart appeared in the middle of their camp. This time, it was an enclosed area the size of half a living room, with a countered window and an outside shelf for the customer. “What can I get for you?”

“I have everything I need right here.” Gra pats his battle axe.

“Well, how about an enhancement?”

Gra looked at his battle axe. It was getting dull from the years of battles he fought; it picked up a few knicks and scrapes along the way. It needed it. “Sure. How much?” Gra pulled out his great axe as well and placed both axes on the counter.

“For both axes, that’ll be 12,000.”

“What about the Robin Hood discount?”

“Oh, right! 10,000.”

“Hmm… it’s steep. Hold on.” Gra hid around the side of the cart so Sui didn’t see. He pulled two patches off his cloak that looked like lumps of yellow. In his hand, they turned into bags of gold. He brought out even more gold from his bag of holding. “How’s this?”

Don took it all and counted it up. “Wonderful! Now just hold on a second.” Don grabbed the two weapons and pulled a metal barrier down from the ceiling, concealing what he was doing. A moment later, he opened the barrier and handed Gra his two axes.

They both looked shiny new, and had a magical shimmer to them. Gra swung them, one in each hand. “Feels good.” He looks down at the handle. “Heh, looks like I got blood on it already.”

“I can fix that.” Don said. He touched Gra on the shoulder, and the blood instantly vanished. He touched Sui too, cleaning him up instantly.

“Thanks.” Gra put his axes in his bag of holding. Then he turned to a munching sound.

Reesu was kneeling next to Robin Hood’s decapitated corpse gnawing on his leg bone.

“What are you doing?” Gra asked.

“Oh I’m sorry.” Reesu turned to Gra, mouth dripping with blood. “Did you want some?”

Gra gave her a defeated face.

Don exited his shop and walked up to Robin Hood. “Why, don’t mind if I do!” He touched Robin Hood’s corpse and it disappeared. Then he went around, poking everyone with blood on them, and cleaning them in an instant. Then he went back to his shop.

Reesu approached, stuffing gold into her pockets.

“What can I get for you?”

“Can I have something because you like me?”

“Well I don’t normally do this, but…” Don reached under the counter and produced a small obsidian stone. “You can have this, free of charge.”

“It’s pretty!” Reesu cheered. “But kind of lumpy.”

“I can fix that.” Don put the barrier up and a second later put it back down. The rock was now in the shape of an arrowhead, and it was tied around a silver necklace.

“Thank you so much, Mr. Don!” Reesu put it around her neck. As she left, Drathalion came up to the counter.

Drathalion folded a map with a drop of blood still on it.

“What can I get for you?”

“Do you have any… um…” Drathalion put a hand to her mouth. “Mobile caves?”

“Not in your price range.”

“No, uh… it’s a small structure that folds out. And it has a flapping door.”

“What?”

Gra came up behind her. “You mean a house?”

“Yeah! A house, but one you can take with you.”

“Tortoise shell?”

“But not hard and doesn’t have to be on your back. It has walls that touch at the top, so not much of a ceiling.”

“Oh! A tent?”

“Yeah that’s it!”

“Yes I do.” Don pulled up a bag full of tent parts. “1 gold.”

“Is it rated for subzero temperatures?”

“Hold on.” Don took the tent into his private shop and came back. The tent was now much fluffier and more insulated. “It is now. 4 gold.”

“Thanks.” Drathalion gave him the gold.

The party had all done their business with Don, so he left. He and his cart simply faded away.

Drathalion set up the tent on the edge of the campground behind some trees. She set up some arrows pointing straight up out of the ground, cast some magic on them, and retired into the tent.

# Chapter 9 – Jerks and Jerky

A robot and a bugbear walk into a bar. This bar was The Sticky Bucket, located in a little snowy town called Canadia.

“Hi, I’m…” The tall firbolg bartender greeted. “…Jodi.”

Silber Posten and Micro the Bugbear sat down at the bar.

“…And I’ll be… I’ll be your bartender today. What can I get for you?”

“Can of oil.”

“Steak.”

Jodi the firbolg bartender entered the kitchen and came right back with refreshments.

“So… what brings you to town?” Jodi asked, hands shaking, as he brought Silber Posten his can of oil.

“Just another day on the job.” Silber Posten flicked a coin at Jodi, who caught it with his face.

“And what is it that you do, if you don’t mind me asking?”

“I’m a bounty hunter. I bounty hunt people. For the right price, of course.”

“Of course.” Jodi took an empty dirty glass off the bar counter, but his shaking hand dropped it. “Oh, so sorry.”

Across the tavern, another glass dropped. “Hurrah!” The patrons on that side of the bar cheered. Another glass hit the floor, this time deliberately.

“They look like they’re having fun.” Micro the Bugbear smiled from ear to ear. “Say, why can’t we ever do that, Silber?”

“Eagle Shot isn’t allowed to get dirty.” The gun on Silber’s back shimmered in the sunlight.

Jodi gulped. “Anything else I can do for you?”

“That’ll be it for now.” Silber took another sip of oil.

“Very well then, I shall be right back, right after I take care of something.”

Silber watched as Jodi cleaned up the mess the rowdy patrons made, and how they treated him. When Jodi came back, Silber motioned to him to come close for a whisper. “For the right price, I can make sure those scumbags never disgrace your tavern again.”

Jodi shivered. “Place a… bounty? On one of my patrons? I wouldn’t dream of it! No, no thank you. Thank you for your business.” Jodi wiped his hands on a cloth and disappeared into the kitchen.

===============

With Gale and Drathalion asleep, and Sui resting by the campfire, only Gra was up to interact with Reesu.

“Hey Gra, wanna see how high we can stack these bandit bodies?”

“Nah, I’m fucking exhausted.” Gra flopped onto the ground, faceplanting into the dirt.

“Come on, Gra! It’ll be fun!” Reesu sat on his head.

“Hmt mof my mead.” Gra mumbled under Reesu. He pushed her, but she didn’t move.

“What was that?” Reesu crouched over his head.

“Get off my head.”

Reesu stood up. “Ok, now do you want to do stuff?”

“No, I’m super sore from that last battle. Gale’s heals helped, but I still need time to recover.”

“Awww…”

“Why don’t you also take a rest? Recover from exerting yourself.”

“But the battle charged me up. I’m bored.”

“Do target practice or something.”

“Hmm… ok. Can I see your bag?”

“What for?”

“Don’t you have arrows?”

“I do.” Gra grunted. “…Here you go.”

“Thanks.” Reesu pulled Robin Hood’s head out of Gra’s bag of holding. She tossed it in the air 30 feet from her, and a tentacle appeared on the ground where it would land, and tossed it back to her. She played catch with herself for a few minutes. Then Robin Hood’s eye popped out of its socket.

“Eehhhyi! Eehhhyi!” Gale turned onto his other side in his sleep.

Reesu smiled evilly. She caught Robin Hood’s head one last time and dismissed her tentacle. She snuck up to Gale’s rock. He seemed to be having a nightmare of some sort, but he was completely unaware of her presence. She laid Robin Hood’s head next to Gale’s, its ghastly agape mouth and hanging eyeball laying inches from his face. Reesu chuckled silently to herself.

Then she realized she was hungry. She raided Gra’s bag of holding and found a treasure trove of deer jerky. She munched happily on it. And then a thought crossed her mind. “What if I made the deer eat deer jerky?” She stood over Gra and poked him on the chest. “Hey Gra?”

“What do you want?”

“Where’s the deer?”

“You mean the *cat*?”

“Oh yeah, where’s the cat?”

Gra pointed in a direction.

“Thanks.” Reesu explored the camp, and found a tent on the edge of it behind a tree. In front of it were four arrows sticking point-up out of the ground. Reesu squinted at them, but they didn’t disappear. “The deer knows the Cordon of Arrows spell?” She tiptoed closer. When she got to the range of the spell, she put a tentacle in. Nothing happened. She stepped in the spell’s range with a foot. Nothing happened. She took a whole step or two with her whole body, and prepared for impact. Nothing happened. She walked right up to the arrows and pulled one out of the ground. “Huh, non-magical. Clever, deer.”

Reesu silently opened the tent’s entrance. Inside, she found Drathalion the cat, fully in the nude. “Wow, that’s one hot cat,” she whispered to herself. Then she remembered that the cat is probably just an illusion. She took a good, long look at the nude tabaxi until it faded away, and revealed the deer underneath. She quietly snuck inside.

The deer breathed regularly for a sleeping deer. Its ears pricked at one of her footsteps, then immediately relaxed again.

Reesu took a bit of deer jerky in her tentacle and slowly slipped it into the deer’s mouth. She stifled a giggle as she savored the moment. Then she slipped out.

As she left, the tent was making noises.

*cough cough REEEEETCH! PUGH! REEEEEEEEEETCH! cough cough*

A rancid smell emanated from the tent.

Reesu giggled all the way back to the campfire, where she pretended to have been sitting this whole time.

“What was that?” Gra asked.

“Oh, Sui was having a bad acid trip.”

“What about me?” Sui turned around.

“Oh, I said I hope you’re having a nice trip.”

“Well, all things considered, I’ve had worse.”

Gra grumbled and closed his eyes again.

Reesu poked at the campfire with a tentacle, enjoying how the embers sparked and crackled.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw something black creep up to the tree next to her and climb up it. She looked into the tree, but saw nothing but tree branches.

All of a sudden, things from her pocket floated up and out. Her two daggers twirled in the air and the obsidian arrowhead she got from Don flew straight into the fire. She was mildly annoyed, but more amused than anything. Finally, someone to play with.

She inspected the fire. The two daggers were barely getting red-hot, and the obsidian stone was just fine. She took out a bottle of alcohol, popped the cork out, and stared up into the tree as she poured out the contents. The fire lit ablaze, heating up her items even more. She looked among the tree branches, but couldn’t see Drathalion or the deer.

Then a spark of light came from the tree branches, and something hit her head. It burned her head and hair. “Ack!” She brushed it off with a fireproof tentacle. Then she turned back to the tree. After a bit of looking around, she noticed one branch was not like the others. Squinting at it revealed that it was actually the deer!

Reesu smiled evilly. She took a chunk of coal from the fire and spoke, “The depths envelope!” A dark cloud formed around the deer, completely blocking light from getting in or out. But Reesu could still see into it just fine.

The deer scrambled, shaking the branch it was on. Its antlers sparked and a brilliant, blinding ball of light blinked into existence, but only for a moment. The dark cloud around the deer swallowed up the ball of light the instant it appeared. The deer felt around the tree and climbed slowly to the top.

Reesu ate deer jerky as she watched the deer breathe rapidly in the darkness at the top of the tree. It was more entertaining than watching Sui down bottles of acid.

“What’s that smell?” Gra asked.

Reesu sniffed the air. The wind was blowing the puke smell from the tent. “Oh, it’s just Sui’s acid potions.”

“What about me?” Sui asked.

“Oh, um… I see you’re running out of acid potions.”

“Yeah. When are we going back to town? I have to buy more.”

“I don’t know.” Reesu shrugged. Then she smiled evilly. “But I can get you some more acid right now.”

“Really? Then do it.”

“Ok, but first, I’ll need something to store it in.”

“Fine, you can use my empty bottles.” Sui handed Reesu a few empty potion bottles. “I guess getting a refill is worth not smashing them.”

Reesu took the bottles in her tentacles.

Sui stared at her.

“What?” Reesu asked.

“The bottles are floating in midair.”

“Yeah, so?”

Sui shrugged and turned back to the fire. “I guess it’s not the weirdest thing I’ve seen since the deer joined.”

“Yeah.”

Reesu tiptoed gleefully to the tent. She opened a flap and was greeted by the most awful-smelling beat stew imaginable. It was all over *everything*! The walls, the ground, the bedroll. Chunks of food and slimy stomach fluid covered it all. Reesu tried not to retch as she covered her nose with a tentacle.

She used her acid-proof tentacles to scrape as much fluid into the potion bottles as she could. She shook them up a bit to hopefully dissolve the bigger chunks, but she could only do so much.

Eventually, she puked as well, which just provided more ammo to her potion bottles. Still, the potions looked a bit too much like puke and not enough like acid. “Nothing a minor illusion can’t fix.” She smiled as she stuck a strand of fleece on each of the bottles. “What you see is not what you get!” The potions turned from dark brown with bits of orange into a smooth, solid green. “Perfect…” She brought the three potion bottles to Sui.

“What is that?” He plugged his nose.

“Acid potion, just like you wanted.”

“That doesn’t smell like acid potion.”

“It’s a stronger acid, that’s why the smell is different.”

“It’s not just different, it’s just plain *bad*.”

“Well, I got it for you. So here you go.”

“Thanks…” Sui hesitantly accepted the potions.

“Well?”

“Well what?”

“Aren’t you going to use them?”

“I’m… saving them for later.” Sui patted his bag. “I’m all healed up for now.”

“Oh, I see.” Reesu grabbed a dagger from the fire with a tentacle and slashed Sui’s legs with it.

“HEY!” Sui yelled. “What was that for?”

“So you can test the potions.”

“Fine, I’ll test it out.”

Reesu eagerly waited for Sui to pour the contents onto his leg wound, but she didn’t anticipate what Sui was going to do.

Sui uncorked the “acid” potion, lifted it to his mouth, gave it a good sniff, and scowled. “You sure this is acid?”

“Yep!”

“Ok…” He plugged his nose and then straight up chugged it! The whole thing! “BLEH! What is that!” Sui threw the bottle on the ground, shattering it. He looked at his leg wound. It indeed was healing, albeit slower than a normal acid potion.

Reesu burst out laughing. She fell onto the ground and rolled around. “You— you drank— you drank it!” She laughed uncontrollably.

“What is it? What did I drink?”

Reesu sat up, regaining some composure. “It’s not acid! Well, it contains acid, but it’s not!” She wiped a tear from her eye with a tentacle. “It’s from the deer.”

“The deer keeps acid potions?”

“No, it’s from the deer’s stomach. It’s puke!”

“Eh! It’s a *stomach* acid potion!” Sui tossed all the stomach acid potions at Reesu, who caught them with her tentacles. “You’re disgusting!”

Reesu laughed even harder.

“Reesu.” Gra bellowed from the ground. “Why was the deer puking?”

Reesu got quiet. “Uh, no reason.”

“What did you do?”

“Nothing, I just gave it a snack.”

“What did you feed it?”

“Just some jerky.”

Gra got up from his spot. “What kind?”

“D… eer?”

“Reesu, you disgusting vile creature. You apologize right now.”

“Ok, Gra.” Reesu huffed. She looked up at the tree where she left the deer. But the dark cloud was nowhere to be found. “Huh, has it been 10 minutes already?” She scanned the tree, but didn’t find the deer anywhere. “Gra, have you seen the deer?”

“Not recentl—I mean, not since the bear attack.”

“Wait… how did you get the deer’s puke if you haven’t seen it?” Sui gagged. “Have you been lugging its puke around this whole time?”

Gra stared at Reesu.

Reesu shrugged and laughed. “Uh, yeah! Just been waiting for the right time to prank you!”

“You’re sick.” Sui turned his back to Reesu.

Reesu entertained herself by squinting at all the dead bodies, trees, and bushes, seeing which one might turn into a deer. But none of them did.

The next morning, Gra found the puke-covered tent. He made Reesu pack it up, clean it, and store it in the bag of holding.

Gale woke up and screamed immediately. “This one is going to have more nightmares.”

Reesu got a kick out of it, but no one else did.

Gra and Reesu searched for Drathalion, but she was nowhere to be seen.

Gra shrugged. “Knowing *her*, she’ll probably be around.”

================

The party traveled along the road. The road took them into a valley, where there was lots of fog. The walked through a gate of sorts, with steel poles making up the doors. They creaked as they blew in the wind.

Reesu stuck a wet tentacle in the air. There was barely any wind.

The path turned from the regular gravel path, to all grass. Or, what seemed to be grass. On further inspection, it *was* grass, but very dead and dry, and more dirt than anything.

A purple light shone through the fog. The party got closer. When they got close enough, they realized it was a giant glowing flower thing, but it moved in response to their footsteps.

Reesu waved her hand back and forth, shoving clouds of fog to the side, revealing the purple plant even more. It also revealed several carved stones sticking up out of the ground. “Are those… tombstones?”

Gra inspected one. “This is a graveyard!” He proclaimed.

A purple flower grew up out of the ground in front of the stone Gra inspected. Then a rotting hand protruded from the earth. A low groan came from the earth, as a zombie dug itself out.

“Retreat!” Gra yelled, leading the party to the exit.

But the path led them to a stone wall. Zombies followed closely behind, arms outstretched.

“This way!”

Gra led the party along the path into a corner.

Reesu crouched in the corner. “Everyone get in here.” She pulled everyone into the corner with her with her tentacles. Then she grabbed the air with her hands and pulled it in, too. The fog thickened around them.

“What is happen?”

“Shhh!” Reesu shushed them.

They listened as the confused, moaning zombies stopped and wandered away.

“Heh, what are we crouching for, eh?” A raspy voice said.

“Shhh! Reesu, be quiet.” Gra said.

“What?” Reesu asked, in her normal voice.

“Would you like some zombie jerky?” The raspy voice said again.

“Reesu that’s gross!” Gra said. “And this is no time for your practical jokes.”

“That wasn’t me!” Reesu defended herself. “Well, not this time, at least.”

“It’s really good, trust me.” The raspy voice said as a gloved hand shoved a decayed strip of meat in Reesu’s face.

“WHAT THE FLIPPER!” Reesu screamed.

“What? It’s good jerky.” The raspy voice revealed itself to be a drow wearing black leather armor. He was munching on something, presumably the “zombie jerky”.

Reesu instinctively reached a tentacle out to grapple the drow, but the drow rolled out of her tentacles. “Who are you?”

“Zombie!” Gale cried. He swung his scimitar at the drow, but the drow ducked, eating his jerky the whole while.

“Chill man.” The raspy-voiced drow said.

“Wait, you’re not a zombie.” Gra noticed.

“No, I’m a drow. I thought that was obvious.”

“Heh heh. Sorry. I thought you were a zombie.” Reesu nervously chuckled. “What are you doing here?”

“Just hanging out, eating zombie jerky.”

“What do you want?” Gra asked.

“I’m Bob.”

“No I asked what do you *want*?”

“I want to join your party.”

“Why?”

“I’ve been in this graveyard a long time.” He took a bite.

“Is that your pet?” Reesu gestured to the purple plant in the middle of the graveyard.

“I try to avoid that.”

“Why join *us*?” Gra asked.

“I’m lonely, and you’re not trying to hunt me. Unlike that robot.”

Reesu was still suspicious. “Are you going to try to eat us? Stab us? Skewer us?”

“No.”

Gra asked, “Is there any reason we should doubt your intentions?”

“No.”

Gale shrugged. “This one relieved is not zombie.”

Gra introduced Gale, “This one is a priest. He can cure any diseases you have.”

“I’m fine.” He munched.

“What are you doing in the graveyard?” Reesu asked.

“Hiding from people hunting me.”

“Is there a bounty on your head?”

Bob shrugged. “People don’t seem to like zombies. So I hide here. The fog is actually pretty nice once you get used to it.”

“You’re not afraid of the zombies?”

“The fog makes them easier to avoid. And hunt. Jerky?”

“Ew.” Reesu shoved it away with a tentacle.

“Ew?” Gra asked. “You eat human all the time!”

“I’m not a cannibal!” Reesu slapped Gra.

“You ate a leg in front of the whole party!”

“No I nibbled on it! Besides, it was fresh. Zombies are… stale.”

“It’s an acquired taste.” Bob admitted.

“Ok,” Gra shrugged. “You seem ok enough. You can join the party, for now. But whatever you do,” he gestured to Reesu, “don’t let this one give you a hug.”

Bob shrugged. “I’m not a hugger.”

Bob led the party through the graveyard, avoiding the zombies and purple plants. They continued on their way down the path, following the map to a town called Canadia.

It was cold there, so Gra pulled the winter coats out of his bag of holding. He gave Bob an extra winter coat he had. The party comfortably crossed into the snowy area.

The streets of Canadia were a sight to behold. Trees lined the streets everywhere, with metal spigots sticking out of them. Several people were pouring a brown sticky substance out of the spigots. Moose walked casually through the streets, occasionally stopping to eat grass or other plants.

The party found the town’s tavern, The Sticky Bucket. Its sign had a picture of a spigot pouring the brown sticky substance out of a tree. Inside, they found a friendly firbolg, towering over the counter.

He greeted them with a smile. “What can I get you guys?”

“Do you have zombie jerky?” Bob asked.

“No…” The firbolg looked confused. “We’re fresh out.”

“Would you like some?” Bob reached for his bag.

“No, our supply room is full.”

“You gotta have some kind of disease.” Gra looked at Bob. “Gale, can you check if he has a disease?”

Gale hesitantly put a hand on Bob’s back. “That one is healthy. But you should not be eating that.”

Bob shrugged.

“So, is there something I can get you?” The firbolg asked. “I got beef, chicken, bacon…”

The party ordered normal food and drink, that wasn’t zombie jerky.

Reesu finished her steak first, and got out of her seat. “Can I give you a hug?” She asked the firbolg bartender.

“Sure.”

Reesu gives Jodi a hug. “You are very fluffy, and soft, and tall.”

“Firbolgs are naturally tall.”

“Can I sit on your shoulders?”

“Sure.” Jodi picked up Reesu and put her on his shoulders.

“Uppies!”

Jodi lifts Reesu so high she can touch the ceiling. She tap-taps on it. The ceiling tap-taps back. It was footsteps.

============

Down the stairs yawned Drathalion. She approached the counter and joined the party.

“Good morning, Drathalion.” Gra cleared a stool for her.

Drathalion gave him a smile as she sat. “Good morning, Gra.”

“What can I get for you?” Jodi asked Drathalion.

“Jodi??” Drathalion’s eyes went wide.

“At your service.” Jodi bowed.

“What are you doing here?”

“Taking your order.”

“No, I mean, *how*… how are you doing here?”

“Quite well, today, thanks for asking.”

“No, uh, I mean…” Drathalion showed Jodi her cast. The letters that Jodi wrote flashed for a moment.

“Oh! It’s you! So this is where you’ve been heading this whole time!”

“Yeah, and somehow… you’re already here?”

Jodi shrugged. “Firbolg secrets, you know how it goes.”

Drathalion shrugged in agreement.

“So, what can I get for you?”

“The usual.” Drathalion licked her lips.

“What are you doing?” Gra leaned over and whispered.

“Ordering food.”

“You just said ‘the usual’.”

“Yeah, so?”

“You’ve never been here before.”

“Oh, right.” Drathalion stammered. “Then I guess I’ll have the… berry thing.”

“Which berry thing?” Jodi asked.

“The warm flat one.”

“He—she means blueberry pancakes.” Gra interjected.

“Yeah that one.”

“Coming right up.”

The party had some fun drawing cards with random wacky effects while Drathalion waited for her pancakes.

Jodi plopped the plate down in front of her and placed a container of brown goo next to it.

“What’s this?”

“Oh, it’s a Canadia special!” Jodi exclaimed. “It’s called syrup. It comes from those trees out there.”

Drathalion stuck her tongue in it. “Hmm! It’s sweeter than most tree saps!”

Just then a loud noise startled Drathalion. A fist slammed a table and mugs splattered to the ground, exposing the tavern to shattered glass and the smell of loose alcohol.

“Hurrah!” One of the men cheered.

Jodi hung his head and sighed.

“Jodi?” Drathalion asked.

“I’ll be right back. I have to clean up a mess.”

“Jodi?”

He turned back to her with a quick smile. “Please wait one moment while I take care of some business.” Jodi left into the kitchen, and came back out with a broom and dustpan.

Drathalion leaned over in her seat to peer behind the wall that separated the bar from the rowdy patrons’ table. Jodi swept up the glass while the rowdy patrons arm wrestled and knocked another mug over, this time right in front of Jodi.

“While you’re at it, might as well clean up this one too!” They all laughed. “And get me another will ya?”

Jodi came back to the bar after a moment.

“I’ve been waiting here for over 5 minutes!” Sui complained. “Where’s my food?”

“Sorry about that, it will be out shortly.”

“Better be.” Sui crossed his arms.

Drathalion’s ears pinned back within her hood as she watched Jodi make Sui’s food.

Meanwhile, the party was having a blast. Gra brought out the Deck of Random Oddities and everyone was getting in on the fun. Gra could move his legs so fast they were a blur, Sui’s scales became slightly thinner, and Bob grew so tall he had to crouch to fit in the building. The whole party laughed as Bob mimed being a giant and destroying stuff.

“Drathalion, your turn!” Gra turned to her and held out the deck.

She looked at him, with a sadness in her eyes.

“Here’s your food.” Jodi brought the food to Sui.

“Finally! Hopefully you cooked it enough.” Sui chowed down.

“Ah, the Deck of Many Things, I see.” Jodi pointed to the deck.

Gra turned to him. “Nah, it’s actually the Deck of Random Oddities.”

“Oh. I’ve never heard of such a deck.”

“Me neither, I got it from this Don merchant.”

“Oh, Don JeLancie? Yeah, I’ve seen him around.”

“Would you like to draw a card?” Gra held the deck out to him.

“Sure, I could use some good luck today.” Jodi picked up a card. His pinkie finger fell off. “Is that supposed to happen?”

“It’s normal.” Reesu assured. “I pinkie promise!”

Everyone laughed.

“Don’t worry, it’s not permanent.” Gra assured.

“Haha, yeah. This deck is hilarious.” Jodi laughed.

“Care to draw another?”

Jodi shrugged. “Sure, why not?” He picked up another card. He grew even taller than he already was. He had to crouch down to just fit in the room. He stumbled backward and leaned up against the wall, bending the wall in a bit with an unsettling crack.

“Hey, can I get a refill?” Sui asked.

“Um…” Jodi looked at the kitchen doorway, which he obviously couldn’t fit through.

“That sounds like a… *tall order* to me!” Reesu chuckled.

Everyone laughed.

More laughing ensued as the rowdy patrons slammed their mugs on the ground and waddled out of the tavern, slamming the door on their way out. The bell was hit so hard it flew off and hit Jodi in the head.

Reesu was quick. “Ring around the Jodi!”

Everyone laughed. Jodi gave an awkward chuckle. Drathalion cringed.

# Chapter 10 – Dangerous Fun

*Author’s Note: This section about Silber and Micro was originally from Chapter 9*

It was a cold and windy day at The Sticky Bucket. Silber Posten and Micro the Bugbear sat snugly at the bar while they ate their breakfast.

“Say, you’re bounty hunters, right?” A fancy merchant with long-sleeved robes sat next to Silber at the bar and pulled out a mug of beer from his sleeve.

“You in the market for one?” Silber asked.

“I am. You see, there’s this rascally bird that’s been flying too high, and who needs brought down a peg. Is that something you can do?”

“Finest sharpshooter in the land. I charge half up front—”

“Deal.” The merchant dropped a bag of gold from his sleeve into Silber’s hand.

Silber pulled his hand in and let it fall to the floor. “Micro, —”

“Got it.” Micro got out of his seat and picked up the gold, peering inside. “Whoo-whee! Yogi Bear would be proud of this haul!”

Silber smiled. “We accept.”

“Excellent. Now here we go.” The merchant snapped his fingers, and all of a sudden the three of them were at the top of a snowy mountain.

Silber fell into the snow, but Micro caught him before he got wet.

“See that?” The merchant pointed to a bird in the sky.

CAAAWWWW! The bird yelled, as it descended towards them.

“That’s Revali. He’s the Champion Archer of Wind’s Crossing. He’s got a big ego and a big bow.”

“One bullet should do the trick.” Silber grabbed his gun.

“I was thinking more like nine.” The merchant pushed the gun away.

“Rule 1: Don’t touch Eagle Shot.”

“I need you to humble him. Challenge him to an archery duel, the people here will know what that means.”

“It’ll be done within the hour.”

The Merchant vanished, and the Aarakocra called Revali landed.

“What are you two doing here?” Revali pointed his bow at them.

“We’re looking for you.”

“Oh yeah? What you want?”

“To challenge you to an archery duel.”

Revali laughed. “No offense, well actually, yeah, offense, but little guys like you don’t have the equipment to take on archers like me. So go home with your little toy and stay out of my town.”

Silber motioned to the mountain. “See that rock?” He aimed his gun and fired. The rock fell off and rolled down the mountain. “Now you don’t.”

Revali’s arrogant smile faded into a frown. “Anyone could’ve hit that rock.”

“Proof it. I challenge you to an archery duel.”

Revali stared straight into Silber’s robotic eyes. “You’re on. And when I beat you, you better be gone immediately!” Revali flew into the air. “Come on, this way.”

======

After the party had their fun with the cards, it was time to start the day. And what better way to start than with breakfast?

“I’ll have a sausage with a side of bread.” Reesu ordered.

“Coming right up.”

“And can the bread be extra long?”

“Sure, I’ll see what I can do.” Jodi took the rest of the party’s orders and went into the kitchen.

“That’s an unusual combination.” Gra commented.

“Yeah just wait until you see.”

“Oh! You have something planned for it?”

“Yep!”

“Alright,” Gra put his empty mug on the counter. “I’m going to go find a blacksmith. I’ll be back.”

“Ok, have fun.” Reesu waved.

Drathalion followed him out.

As Gra exited the tavern, he noticed. “Ah, got some weapons to upgrade, Astalir?”

Drathalion shrugged. “Hmm.”

They walked through town, looking for the blacksmith.

“Is something wrong?”

“Jodi seemed rather upset by them.”

“Who?”

“The rowdy bar patrons. They keep smashing glasses.”

“Ah, they’re just having fun. That’s bars for you.”

“Is that how you would have fun?”

“No, but I’m not one to judge.”

“So if I were to have fun by, say, stuffing a sausage down your throat, you’d be ok with that?”

Gra shrugged. “I suppose.”

They found the blacksmith’s shop. Gra got his shortbow upgraded, and then offered to pay for Drathalion’s shortbow to be upgraded. She accepted.

“Thank you.” Drathalion put her shortbow on her back.

“I thought that would cheer you up.”

Drathalion’s ears were still pinned back.

“Hmm. You’re still down about the rowdy bar guests, huh?”

Drathalion nodded.

“And this Jodi is your friend?”

Drathalion showed him the cast on her arm. The illusion around it dissipated long enough for Gra to see the “\<3 Jodi” written lovingly on the side.

Gra’s eyes went wide. “I see.” He put his fist to his chin for a moment. “Well, there’s no harm in asking them to go have their fun somewhere else.”

Drathalion’s ears perked.

Gra and Drathalion got back to the tavern, where the party was still eating breakfast.

“Hey Gra!” Reesu waved a sausage. “Look at this!” Reesu put the sausage in a piece of bread, and then dipped it in some soup.

Gra grimaced. “Why?”

“Because it’s tasty.” Reesu pushed it to Gra along the counter. “Try some.”

Gra looked at it, and then pushed it back. “No thank you. I’ve had my breakfast today.”

“No really! It’s really good!”

“I don’t like mixing my peas and potatoes, let alone my meat and bread.”

“Ah, ok…”

“This one also thinks is disgusting.” Gale ate a clam.

“It’s not disgusting, it’s delicious.”

“This one disagrees.”

“All you ever eat is clams. How would you know?”

“This one eats lots of things. Clam is favorite.”

“You do? Prove it. Eat this sausage.”

Gale took one look, then looked away. “No.”

“Eat it!” Reesu demanded. “Eat it!”

“No, this one will not.”

The sausage in the bread floated into the air and dove into Gale’s mouth. “Eat it!”

“No—mmph!” Gale’s mouth suddenly became full of sausage and bread. His mouth clamped down around it, biting off a big chunk. Then the mouthful all went down his throat, without being chewed.

Gale started turning blue and he gagged.

Gra stood up. “Reesu!”

“Don’t worry,” Reesu waved. “Once it gets to his stomache, he’ll start breathing again.” An outside force helped Gale’s esophagus transport the solid mass into his belly.

But he didn’t start breathing again. His throat swelled up.

Jodi came back into the room. “How is everything—oh my gods!” Jodi leaned over the counter with a glowing hand and punched Gale in the gut.

Gale puked all the sausage and bread out of his stomach, along with some clams. He took a deep, wheezing breath as he gagged the last bits of vomit out of his throat.

“Are you ok?” Jodi asked.

Gale nodded as he got to his feet. “This one… fine…”

“So sorry about that. I asked the fisherman if he was sure those clams were fresh, and he assured me they were. I’ll be sure to throw them out.”

“No, no, no,” Gale objected. “No waste clams! That one—” he pointed to Reesu. “Fed this one *bread*!”

Jodi looked puzzled.

“You’re allergic to bread?” Reesu burst out laughing.

“This one yinglet. Yinglet no eat bread. And for good reason.”

“Hi everyone!” Reesu teased. “I’m Gale the Yinglet! My one weakness is bread!”

“Reesu!” Gra stared.

“What? I’m just trying to have fun…” Reesu buried her face in a mug of alcohol.

“Ok, from now on, no one gives Gale any bread.” Gra declared.

A chunk of vomited up bread floated into the air and headed for Reesu’s pocket. It immediately smashed into the floor.

“Hey!” Reesu looked around. Everyone was already looking at her. She eyed Drathalion, who stared back.

Just then another patron entered the bar. Jodi smiled and waved at her, and she came up to the bar and sat next to the party.

“Hey Daisy, the usual?” Jodi brought her a cup of beverage.

“Same as always.” She smiled. She took a sip and then addressed the party. “Good day.”

“Hi, are you his firbolg girlfriend?” Reesu teased.

“I sure hope not.” Daisy giggled. “I’m his cousin.”

“Oh.” Reesu blushed.

“Hey everyone, this is my cousin, Daisy. Daisy, this is mt friend…” He looked at Drathalion briefly.

Drathalion shook her head subtly.

“Um… These are some new guests in town.”

“Pleased to meet you.” Daisy nodded.

“I like your hair!” Reesu said, as a strand of Daisy’s curly hair floated out towards Reesu.

“Thank you. I take good care of it.” Daisy patted her hair back down.

“Daisy, have you seen Toppol?” Jodi asked.

“No, isn’t he back in the kitchen?”

“No, he isn’t. He didn’t show up to work yesterday either.”

“He’s probably on a delivery. Maybe to Wind’s Crossing?”

“I checked the delivery orders. There’s nothing here about Wind’s Crossing. And besides, we’ve only ever delivered there once several years ago.”

“Sleeping in?”

“For two days? That’s not like him.”

“I can look for him.” Drathalion volunteered. “Do you know where he lives?”

Jodi wrote his address on a piece of paper. “Here.”

Drathalion took the note, and then tapped Gra on the shoulder. “I might need some help.”

“Ok.” Gra stood up. He nodded at Daisy. “Daisy, it was nice to meet you, but me and Ast—Drathalion here have to go look for Toppa.”

“I hope you find him.”

Drathalion nodded.

Gra and Drathalion left, heading straight for the given address.

When they got there, Gra knocked on the door. “Hello? Toppa? Are you there?”

“Toppol, we’re friends of Jodi’s.” Drathalion added.

They waited for a minute. No response.

Drathalion pressed her ears to the door. “I don’t hear anything.”

“Well I guess he’s not home.”

“Hold on.” Drathalion, using a lockpick, finagled the door open. The latch was unlocked, but the door didn’t open. Drathalion leaned into the door, and it finally burst open.

The inside was bloodsoaked. Blood covered the inside of the door, soaked into the carpet, and dotted the walls. But only in this one spot.

“It looks like someone was murdered here.” Drathalion noted.

“But then where’s the body?” Gra pushed past her to look inside.

Drathalion shut the door and turned into Astalir.

They searched the house. The dining room had burnt-out candles lining the table, which was set with fine tableware. The kitchen was full of moldy foods, some of which were chopped next to the stove. A pot of moldy soup sat on the stove, kept warm by a gas-fueled flame. Astalir looked at the stove and it turned itself off. The bedrooms were messy, albeit empty of clues. The bathroom was similarly clueless. The backdoor was blocked by a huge pile of empty vegetable crates.

Finally, Astalir checked the basement. It was dark down there. He tried to stare through it with his dark vision, but it was still dark. He brightened up the room with his antlers, but it was still dark.

“I can’t see down there.”

“Let me see.” Gra investigated, and found the same thing. His lit torch got swallowed by the darkness. “This isn’t normal darkness.”

A scurry and a squeak approached from the dark, and multiplied 10 times.

Astalir closed his eyes, antlers aglow. “It’s some kind of small, furry thing.”

“Probably a rat.”

“Maybe.” Astalir focused on it. It scraped and scratched the floor, resisting Astalir’s magical pull.

In the light, Gra was confirmed correct. It was a rat. But not an ordinary one. Its front teeth were jagged and asymmetrical, red with dripping blood. Its eyes were bloodshot and stared with intent to kill. Upon seeing Gra and Astalir, it leapt at them, jaws agape.

“Gah!” Gra screamed in surprise. He instinctively threw his fist at it. The rat flew back into the darkness, in which it scurried away. “You ok?”

“Yeah, it didn’t hit me at all.”

“Do you think Toppa is in there?”

“Based on the blood stains at the front door,” Astalir pondered, “and the lack of blood trail… I’d say no, Top*pol* isn’t in there.”

“We can’t go in there anyway.” Gra rubbed his fist. It wasn’t bleeding.

“Jodi’s not going to like this.”

“We don’t know what happened to him. Maybe he just had an accident and is at the hospital.”

“There would be a blood trail leading somewhere.” Astalir illuminated the bloody area with his antlers.

“Maybe this bloodstain is old?”

“The front door was stuck shut because of the dried blood. That means that the front door wasn’t used since the “accident”. Based on the blockage by the backdoor, it would mean he’s been using a window to get in and out.”

“Yeah, that seems unlikely.” Gra laughed. “Well then, what happened to him?”

“I don’t know.” Astalir looked around suspiciously. He turned back into Drathalion and opened the front door. Outside, there was no sign of a blood trail.

Gra and Drathalion returned to the tavern. Along the way, a moose took a dump as it crossed the street in front of them. The turd mysteriously followed them to the tavern.

Reesu greeted them at the door. “Guess what Gra!”

“What?”

“I’ve got a surprise for you!” Reesu jumped at Gra and slammed a bread-covered sausage down his throat. “All the way down the hatch!” The sausage and bread forced themselves down his throat.

Gra gagged at first, but then decided to swallow. “Reesu! That… was both tasty and disgusting. And dangerous!”

“No, it was fun!”

“Maybe for you!” Gra spit the remaining chunks of bread out of his mouth.

The mysterious floating moose turd wandered over to Reesu, aiming for her skirt pocket.

“Ew!” Reesu swatted it away with an invisible tentacle. “Astalir! That’s gross!”

“What?” Drathalion turned to her. “Who’s Astalir? I’m Drathalion.”

Reesu squinted at the cat. “Don’t play games with me.”

“I think what they’re trying to say,” Gra separated the two. “Is that you shouldn’t force things on people when they don’t want it.”

“Hmmph.” Drathalion nodded, relaxing a bit.”

“Ok, I’ll let this one slide…” Reesu stared at Drathalion.

“Now let’s get back in the tavern.”

They sat down in their previous seats at the bar.

Jodi approached Drathalion, cleaning a glass. “Any luck?”

Drathalion shook her head. “We didn’t find him.”

“I hope he’s ok.”

Drathalion looked down at the counter, hood up. “I hope so too.”

# Chapter 11 – Breaking Bad Habits

*Author’s Note: This section about Silber and Micro is originally from Chapter 9*

It was a windy day in Wind’s Crossing. Specks of snow swam across the white peaks, dusting everything in its path. The windsock on a nearby pole danced in a particular direction, changing which way it pointed every now and then. The grass crunched under Silber’s weight as Revali led him to the shooting range.

“There’s 3 rounds.” An aarakocra with its whistle around its neck, known as Teba, announced. “Each round you have 1 shot per target to try to hit it. The first round is normal, the second round is blindfolded, and the third round is upside down. Any questions?”

Revali raised his hand. “How badly do you think I’m going to beat him?”

Teba ignored him. “Alright, Revali, you can go first.”

“No, I want the newbie to go first. Good luck, you’ll need it.”

“Luck is for people who can’t aim.” Silber nonchalantly set up his gun stand and placed Eagle Shot on it. He dusted some snow off it. Looking through the scope, he angled his gun towards the target 100ft away. He pulled the trigger. *BOOM!*

“Inner ring: 50 points!” Teba declared.

Silber adjusted his stand and lined up for the 200ft target. *BOOM!*

“Bullseye!”

“Looks like I’m not wasting my time with an amateur.” Revali retorted.

And lastly, Silber shot the 300ft target. *BOOM!*

“Bullseye!”

“Lucky shot.” Revali put a wing to the wind. “South-east. Now let me show you how it’s really done.” Revali took out an immaculately carved bow and loaded an arrow into it. He shot at the first target.

“Inner ring: 50 points!”

“Damn. The wind changed direction just as I shot.” He touched his wing to the wind again. “East.” He shot the 200ft target.

“Near miss: 0 points.”

“Looks like you might need some luck.” Silber said.

“That arrow was defective.” Revali searched his quiver for a perfect arrow and loaded it. He lined up his shot, and shot the arrow straight into the 300ft target.

“Bullseye!”

“Ha! You see, stranger. *That* is how it’s done!” Revali held his wings in the air, as if trying to get a crowd to cheer.

“Round 2: blindfolded.” Teba announced.

Micro helped Silber put on his blindfold. Revali put his on by himself.

Silber blasts through all three targets, even with the blindfold on. He didn’t get a single bullseye though.

“Hmmph. Not a single bullseye? Pathetic.”

Revali on the other hand, struggles. He barely hit the first two, but somehow manages to hit the last shot. “The wind was so loud I couldn’t hear the target.”

“Round 3: Upside down!” Teba announced.

Micro held Silber upside down. He shot all three targets with ease, even with keeping the blindfold on.

“Heh, not a single bullseye. And you had to get help.” Revali gagged. “Watch this!” He flapped his wings and spun around in the air, floating upside down. He shot all the targets in quick succession, hitting every target. The last hit was a bullseye. “Bullseye!” Revali landed. “What do you think, Teba? Should I kick out this loser the old-fashioned way, or should I make him a new target? He looks like he could take at least a hit or two before we have to replace him.”

Teba counted the points on a clipboard he carried. “Winner—”

“Revali!” Revali cheered.

Teba grunted. “Winner: Silber!”

“What!” Revali grabbed the clipboard and looked at the points. “You totaled these wrong!”

Teba took back his clipboard. “No, that’s correct. I triple-checked it. You’ve been beaten, fair and square.”

“But he has a gun! And I have a bow. He should be forced to use a bow too!”

“You should’ve declared that as a part of the challenge.” Teba shrugged.

“I want a rematch.”

“You’re beat. We’re done here.” Silber refused.

“Come on!”

“No.”

Micro growled.

Revali broke an arrow in two and threw its pieces on the ground. “This isn’t over.” Revali flew off to his house.

Slow clapping appeared behind Silber. “Well done. I’ve never seen that bird be put down like that before.” It was Don, fading into view. “What are you? Some sort of golem?”

“I prefer the word ‘turret’.”

“Ha! Well with aim like that, you certainly are.”

“I believe there was a bounty on Revali’s pride?”

“Yes. How about a discount on some magic bullets? They’re buy 3 get 1 free.”

“I’ll take 12.” Silber nudged Micro, who handed Don a bag full of gold.

Don chuckled as he took the bag and handed over a handheld box. “Excellent.”

=======

“I’m tired of waiting around. Gra, can I see those cards?” Sui asks.

“Knock yourself out.” Gra hands the deck to him.

“I’m going to draw 5 cards, and they’re all going to be good ones.” Sui states. He draws the first card.

Gra looks over his shoulder at it in anticipation of what’s to come.

“Yes! Finally! Something good!” Sui exclaims. The card activates, and Sui’s eyes draw closed as he slumps forward in his seat, slapping his face onto the counter. A little bit of drool dribbles out of his mouth.

“Sui?” Gra leans over.

Sui snores in response.

“Sui,” Gra said. “I didn’t mean that literally!”

“Oh wow he’s really out!” Reesu exclaimed. She giggled as she got off her stool. “I just got a really funny idea. Wait right here.” She left the tavern.

“Oh no…” Gra groaned, rubbing his forehead.

“You ok?” Daisy asked. “You look stressed.”

“I’m fine. It’s just Reesu, like usual.”

“Oh what’s wrong with her?”

“I don’t know. She’s a psychopath or something.”

“Well I have something to take your mind off things.”

“What’s that?”

“Have you heard of the stick game?”

“No.”

“I’ll explain it.” Daisy took out a stick. “I hide the stick behind my back, and now you have to guess which hand it’s in.”

“That one.”

“You got it! That’s one point for you.” Daisy passed the stick. “Now it’s your turn.”

“Ok which hand is holding the stick?”

“Your left hand.”

“Nope. It was my right hand.”

“Good one. My turn.”

Daisy and Gra played the stick game for a while.

======

Reesu followed her nose to the butcher shop in town. Inside, there was a clear display full of all sorts of meat: ham, bacon, porkchops, etc. Reesu rang the bell on the top.

“Just a minute.”

Reesu snatched a raw slice of bacon with an invisible tentacle and slurped it up before the butcher arrived.

“What can I get for you?”

“Something smells really good in here.” Reesu wafted it all in. “What are you working on back there?"

“Tsk, tsk.” He shook his head. "‘It's a shame, you’re so young. But needs are needs. Now what part would you like?”

“Do you have blood?”

“How much?”

“I want a big bucket full.”

“Aw! You’re a hungry little one. I’ll get that for you.” He went into the back and hobbled over with a bucket almost as big as Reesu, filled to the brim with a scarlet liquid.

“How much?”

“For you, it’s free. Just so long as you promise when you’re full grown, you won’t feed on me.” The butcher chuckled.

“Huh?”

“You know, ‘the lily wilts at sunset’?”

“What are you talking about?”

“Wait, are you not a…” The butcher stopped himself. “Have a good day, little one.”

“Not a what? I’m not a what?”

“Not old enough to be buying blood on your own?”

Reesu gave him a quizzical glance, too confused to be mad. She shrugged. “If being over 900 years old isn’t old enough, I don’t know what is.”

“I-I-I—wow….” The butcher stammered. “You’re higher rank than you look. I’m deeply sorry, countess.”

“Ok… thanks for the blood.”

“Anytime.”

The bucket floated above Reesu’s head as she left, and the butcher stared in awe at how easily she moved it.

Reesu returned to the tavern. As she entered, Drathalion discretely snuck out a side window to avoid her. “That deer’s smart.”

Sui lay unconscious on his stool, head slumped over on the counter.

Reesu chuckled evilly to herself as she turned invisible and snuck up on Sui. With a *WHAM!* She turned visible again and slammed the bucket of blood upside down onto Sui’s head. Blood splattered everywhere: Sui, Sui’s stool, the counter around Sui, the floor around Sui, and the people around Sui, namely Gra.

“Reesu! What are you doing!” Gra yelled.

“Surprise!”

“Gah!” Gra wiped himself off with a napkin.

“He’s still asleep.” Reesu peeked under the bucket at Sui’s eyes. “That unconscious card really works wonders.”

“He’s lucky, not having to be awake to see this.”

“What’s going on?” Sui poked his head up, completely in the dark under the bucket. “Why’s everything smell like blood?”

“It’s because it is blood!”

“Reesu! That’s gross!”

“Don’t worry, I got it from the butcher. It’s professionally sanitized.”

“I don’t think that’s how it works.”

“Wait…” Sui sniffed the blood. “Is this *human* blood?”

“Let me see.” Reesu dipped a finger in the bloody pool and tasted it. “Wow, you’re right! It *is* human blood!”

“Where did you get *human* blood?” Gra stood up.

“The butcher shop.”

“Hey what’s this?” Reesu picked up the stick that Daisy had set on the counter.

“That’s a stick. For the stick game.” Daisy explained the rules to Reesu.

Reesu and Daisy play a round, and Daisy wins.

“Wow, you’re good at this game.” Reesu said.

“I’ve been playing it since I was a kid.”

“I want a rematch. Gra, help me out.”

“2 versus 1? That doesn’t sound fair.” Gra said.

“It’s ok, I’ve got Jodi on my team.” Daisy called out. “Right, Jodi?”

“Sure.” He responded from the back.

“Well, that’s not fair. You’ve both been playing this your whole lives.”

“Ok, I’ll take Gra and you can take Jodi.” Daisy suggested.

“This one help Gra.” Gale hopped onto Gra’s lap.

“Ok, but now we need a third person.” Reesu looked at Drathalion.

The whole party looked at her.

The cat took one look at Reesu and shook her head. “I’d rather not.”

“Come on, we gotta balance the team.” Gra said. “You’d be on Jodi’s team.”

“Ok.” Drathalion sat next to Jodi.

The party played the stick game, but with a coin. Drathalion tried sticking the coin in Reesu’s pocket when it was there turn to hide, but Reesu batted it away, and Jodi ended up hiding the coin. In the end, Jodi’s experience mixed with Drathalion’s illusions won them the game. The party all said good game.

Drathalion’s ears pricked. She got up from the bar.

Gra asked, “Where are you going?”

“Out to pee.” Drathalion walked out the front door.

Daisy gawked. “She does know the bar has a bathroom, right?”

Gra shrugged. “She’s a wild animal. She prefers trees.”

Daisy did a double take. “I’m so confused.”

Reesu slid a drink to her. “Don’t worry about it. Ale?”

Daisy took a sip.

Meanwhile, outside, Drathalion stood next to a tree just past the treeline. “Ah, this is so much easier as a biped.”

A small crowd rustled and bustled up to the tavern door.

Drathalion peeked around to see who it was. It was the ruffians, the ones who shattered mugs for fun and caused her friend a lot of stress. They swung the door open wildly, nearly pulling it off its hinges. Drathalion stopped pissing.

She snuck through the trees to the tavern entrance, and followed them in discreetly. She hid up against a wall with a good line of sight to their table.

They sat at their usual table, which was more or less reserved for them, due to the fact it was beaten and battered and a bit sticky from all their antics. No one else was willing to sit there. They pushed aside the broken bits of glass under the table to make way for their muddy boots.

“Firbolg! Your guests are here!” They yelled into the kitchen.

“Y-yes?” Jodi emerged, notebook ready. “W-what can I g-get for you tod-today?”

“B-beer!” The orc mocked. “And wipe this table!” He pointed to a message on the table reading, *GO AWAY YOU RUFFIANS*. “I don’t appreciate graffiti on my table. Unless it’s mine.” He ran his fingers over an etching, *MOG WAS HERE*. “Ha.”

“Yes-s, of course.” Jodi went back to the kitchen, grabbed four beers and a rag. “S-so sorry.” He wiped the offending message with soap and water, but it didn’t disappear. Instead, it changed.

*YOU RUFFIANS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.*

Jodi wiped it again.

*LEAVE NOW OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES*.

Mog grabbed Jodi’s arm. “What you trying to pull? I said wipe it off.”

Jodi sweated, and dumped the water pale on the floor as he pulled his arm back from the orc. “M-my apologies. I’ll g-get that cleaned.”

Drathalion let the menacing text fade, and sent a message to Gra by writing on his mug, *THEY’RE BACK*.

Gra took one look at the mug and took a sip instead of getting up. His drink floated to the back to the bottom of the mug instead of going into his mouth.

*HELP*.

Gra sighed. “Ok.” He got out of his seat. He approached the table.

“Why, if it isn’t Gra the Halfbreed.” Mog slammed his mug on the table. “Came to finish what we started?”

Gra took a deep breath, and laid his hands on the table. “Mog, you have to leave.”

“Listen to this half-orc scum.” Mog grabbed his mug. “He can’t stand being in the presence of a pure-breed.”

“Mog, you have to leave.” Gra clenched his fist.

“I have to leave as much as you should’ve left your mother’s womb. Not at all.” The ruffians all laughed and took another swig.

Gra grumbled.

“What are you going to do, rage on us?” Mog pointed at Gra. “I assume you remember what happened *last time* you did that?”

Gra slammed his fist on the table, pounding the table so hard their drinks nearly spilled. “Leave now, or there won’t be a *next time*.”

Mog nearly fell out of his chair. “Calm down, half-man. We were already on our way out. Weren’t we, boys?”

The other three ruffians all nodded. They threw their empty mugs against the wall, shattering them. Then they got up and left.

Gra stood there, huffing over the table, even after they left.

“Thanks, Gra.” Jodi handed Gra a mug of beer. “Here’s a beer, on the house.”

Gra didn’t even look. He grabbed the mug and threw it against the wall.

Jodi took a step back. “W-whoa.”

Gra snapped out of it, looking around. “Oh, hi Jodi.” He glanced at the mug he just destroyed. “Sorry about that, I’ll clean it up.”

“It’s no problem—”

“No, I… I need to do it.” Gra took the broom from Jodi and gathered the glass shards into a pile.

“Wow Gra, you didn’t explode this time!” Reesu poked Gra. “You’ve really grown in the 15 years I was away.”

“Reesu, don’t test me right now.”

“Why, are you going to *rage*?” Reesu pulled herself up onto his shoulder and whispered in his ear.

Gra turned his head, and continued sweeping. He whistled a tune.

“Wow, you’re managing your anger so well. But what if I—”

A piece of glass floated up and bee-lined for Reesu’s pocket.

“Hey!” She slapped the piece of glass back to the floor. She looked around. Drathalion was still standing in the corner. “I’ll make you eat this! Don’t mess with me!”

Drathalion hid deeper in the corner.

Gra pointedly whistled louder.

Reesu sighed. “Gra, we don’t do anything fun anymore.” She complained. “Why don’t we go punch some holes in some walls? Isn’t that what you want to do right now?”

Gra whistled, sweeping faster.

“When I left you, you were so little back then. But now you’re big. Ah, you’re still as nice as ever.”

“And you’re still as scary as ever.”

“Thank you.”

“AHHHH!” Sui woke up with a bucket on his head. “Why am I covered in human blood!”

“Human?” Gra glared at Reesu. “You told me you got it from the butcher.”

“I did.” Reesu hopped off Gra and went over to Sui to take the bucket off. “There, all better.” She licked the top of his head. “Wow, that *is* human blood. No wonder it smelled so good.”

“The butcher gave you human blood?” Drathalion stepped out of the shadows. She looked at Gra.

“We gotta check that out.” Gra handed the broom to Jodi. “Reesu, hop on.”

“Are we going to punch down some walls?”

“We’re going to go punch down some walls.” Gra motioned to Gale and Daisy as he marched out of the tavern.

“Bye! Thanks for taking that elsewhere!” Jodi waved.

Reesu showed Gra where she got the blood from. Drathalion, Gale, and Daisy followed behind him.

“This is definitely the place.” Reesu sniffed the air. They entered the shop.

“Ah, countess, welcome back.” The butcher said. “I trust you enjoyed the bucket?”

“Oh, I enjoyed it immensely.” Reesu laughed.

“And I see you brought your friends. I’m sorry, but I don’t think I have enough… supply… to satisfy all of you.”

“Well then.” Gra slammed the bucket of human blood on the counter. “You can satisfy me by telling me where you got this bucket of *human* blood.”

The butcher gulped. “That’s pig’s blood.”

“He’s lying!” Reesu cheered.

Gra and Reesu interrogated the butcher, while Drathalion snuck out around back. She opened the back door quietly, such that the old squeaky hinges didn’t even make a peep. She stepped lightly around the messy puddles on the floor, and found the freezer room, where a human body was hanging from a hook. It was pale and had a few pieces chopped off.

Drathalion wiggled her fingers at the floor, causing glowing text to appear in a trail, *DEAD BODY THIS WAY DEAD BODY THIS WAY DEAD BODY THIS WAY*. Then she snuck out back again and made her way to the party.

Daisy screamed when she saw the text trail on the floor. “You do kill humans!”

“No I didn’t kill anyone!” The butcher protested.

“Then how do you explain that?” Gra pointed.

Reesu faded from existence. A tip-tap-patter-tap traveled down the hall, following the glowing words.

“*I* didn’t kill him!” The butcher insisted. “I merely processed him.”

“Making zombie jerky?” Bob asked.

“I’m just doing what my customer base wants. Don’t hurt me.”

“Why butcher?” A voice moaned from down the hall. “Why do I have no hands?”

Everyone turned to see what it was. A limp-limbed humanoid with no pants on crept slowly toward them. The light in the hall was dim, illuminated only by the text on the floor. It moaned in pain the whole way. Finally, it got close enough to the light to make out its face.

“Toppol!” Daisy gasped. “What have you done to him?”

“He killed me…” The walking corpse that was formerly known as Toppol pointed with a floppy finger at the butcher.

“I didn’t! I didn’t!” He ripped his apron off and threw it on the corpse, and ran out of the building.

“Nah-uh!” Reesu reached out. “Where do you think you’re going?”

The butcher struggled to move, but he soon floated into the air. “Please, I have family! Don’t hurt me!”

“So did Toppol!” Daisy spat through tears. “I’m getting the cops.”

“No need, I’ll butch him right here.”

“Reesu, not in public!” Gra pulled her back.

“Aw… but I want to see his guts.”

“No.”

“Ok.”

Daisy returned with an officer. After presenting the evidence, and presenting more evidence, the officer finally agreed to arrest the butcher. He threw him in jail.

Reesu entered the shop and went behind the counter, opening the cash register. “Gra, I need your bag.”

“Yeah, sure, whatever.”

“Thanks.” Reesu dumped the cash register’s contents into the bag.

Except for coin, which rolled on the floor around the counter. Reesu reached down to pick it up, but it floated on its own toward her pocket.

“Drathalion! I said no!” Reesu swatted the coin with an invisible tentacle, but it didn’t move. “No!” She swatted it some more, with her actual hands even. It kept coming. “No! Astalir! No!”

The coin floated into her pocket, which shifted in a way that resembled a coin going into it.

“No!” Reesu put her hand in her pocket but found nothing. She pulled her pockets out, but there was nothing in it.

Drathalion showed herself, smug expression on her face.

“Why? Astalir why?”

“You know why.” Drathalion snapped her fingers and a piece of deer jerky appeared in Reesu’s hand.

She crushed it, but it was an illusion. “Ok, what do you want?”

“I want an apology. And an assurance you won’t do it again.”

Reesu grumbled. “How about this?” Reesu took off her necklace that Don had given her. It was a piece of obsidian in the shape of an arrowhead on a string. She handed it to her.

Drathalion took it and put it in her pocket. “I’ll accept this apology.”

“So we’re agreed on no more forcing things into other’s pockets?”

“And mouths.”

“Fiiine.” Reesu pushed past Drathalion. “But you’re no fun.”

“Good.”

# Chapter 12

=== 2023-11-25 ===

=== Chapter under construction ===

“That butcher deserves the full force of the law for killing Toppol.” Daisy clapped her hands together. “I’m sure glad we took care of him.”

“So am I!” Reesu happily munched on a raw leg bone, peeling the flesh off with her teeth.

“Where’d you get that?” Daisy asked. “Who’s leg is that?”

Reesu smiled evilly. “Don’t worry, it’s *not* Toppol.”

“Spit him out! He deserves a proper burial!”

“No!”

“Spit him out!”

“No!”

“Ok, break it up.” Gra came between them. “Reesu, spit it out.”

“Ah, why are you siding with her?” Reesu spat Toppol’s leg into Daisy’s arms.

Daisy’s face went from disgust to despair.

“Because your cannibalistic tendencies should not be encouraged.” Gra insisted.

“But I’m not a cannibal!”

“Yes you are.”

“YeS yOu ArE.” Reesu mocked.

Gra grumbled.

Meanwhile, Drathalion was deep in thought. The butcher had said that he didn’t kill Toppol. But if he didn’t, who did? Toppol’s house had a big patch of blood on it, so that was most likely the scene of the murder. So how did Toppol’s body end up at the butcher’s shop? There was lots of blood all over the butcher shop, but it could have been from other animal bodies.

“Hey, Ali—Drathalion, are you ok?” Gra put a hand on her shoulder.

“Yeah, I’m fine, just thinking about Toppol.”

“The world is a cruel place.” Gra shrugged. “These things happen.”

“Hmm.”

“But hey, if it makes you feel better, you can sleep in my room tonight.”

“Thanks, Gra, I’ll do that.”

“This one also does no want to sleep alone.” Gale said.

“It’s ok, Gaaale!” Reesu picked Gale up. “You can sleep with me.”

“Oh, this one no—”

“Come on Gale! It’ll be fun!”

“Ok, this one accepts.”

The party gets to the inn.

Daisy ran in with a leg, crying.

“Daisy! What’s wrong?” Jodi caught her in a big hug. “Are you ok?”

She couldn’t get words out enough to speak.

“Toppla is… no longer with us.” Gra took the leg. “But we caught the guy who butchered him.”

“The guy who *butchered* him.” Drathalion repeated.

“What? Toppol’s dead?” Jodi rubbed Daisy’s back.

Drathalion nodded. “Unfortunately. Jodi…” Drathalion put her palms towards his face. *HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS IN THIS TOWN?*

Jodi shook his head. He squeezed Daisy tight.

Drathalion glowered at no one in particular.

“Hey Jodi, sorry to interrupt, but we need a room.” Gra said.

Jodi nodded, a tear in his eye. “Isenyul!”

A dwarf came out from the kitchen. “Yes?” He took one look at Jodi. “Oh.” Then he looked at Gra. “Do you need help with your leg, sir?”

“No, I’d like a room.”

“Ah, doing some DIY medical treatment?”

“No.”

“Well you better take care of that soon, before your leg rots away.”

“It’s not my leg.” Gra sighed. “I just need a room.”

“Well it won’t be any longer if you treat it like that.”

“Please, I need a room.”

“Ok, here’s number 2.” The dwarf handed Gra a key. “Good luck with your leg.”

Gra went up to his room without saying a word. Drathalion followed.

“Aye, do the more of ya need a room?” The dwarf addressed the rest of the party.

Bob got a room for himself.

Then Reesu raised her hand. “Me! I want a room!”

“Aw little lass, you should ask your parents.”

“I want a room!”

“Ok, are your parents around?”

“I’m not a kid, I’m old enough to get a room for myself.”

“No, young lass, you must be an adult to rent a room.”

Reesu sighed. “Ok, here’s some gold. My parents asked me to rent a room for them.”

“Ok. Here’s the key to room 3.”

“No, I want the key to the room that smells nice. Right, Gale?”

“Ah, yes!” Gale nodded. “This one also wants a room that smells nice.”

“Is this your parent? I thought it was your pet.”

“Sure.” Reesu said. “Can I have that room key?”

“Room 3 smells nice, last I checked.”

“No, I want the one down the hall from it.”

“Which room is that?”

“Room 6.”

The dwarf leaned over the counter and stared straight into Reesu’s eyes. “You’re not a little girl, are you?”

Reesu leaned in close and whispered confidently, “The lily wilts at sunset.”

The dwarf, wide-eyed, nodded slowly in realization. “Right. Of course. I’ll get that for you.” He dips behind the counter and then rises again with the key.

The key was a normal skeleton key, made of iron. It had several dark splotches on it that smelled vaguely of human blood. The tag it came with was non-uniformly maroon with a recently painted “6” on it. Closer inspection reveals several more fainted 6s behind layers of red.

Reesu licked it. “Yep, that’s the one.”

“Just one question, young lass.” The dwarf grabbed her hand. “A rat? Are you sure that’s wise?”

“Who are you to question *me*?”

“Yes, you’re right. Very sorry.” He backed off. “What would you like me to feed the rat?”

“Is that one talking about this one? This one no rat.”

“Oh, he’ll have clams. Can you deliver that to the room?” Reesu jumped to adjust Gale on her shoulders.

“”Yes, very well.”

Reesu whispered quietly to the dwarf. “And can you make them alcoholic?”

“If you want.” The dwarf then addressed Gale. “I hope you have no regrets.”

“What that mean? This one confused.”

“Nothing, Gale, he’s being tricky. Come on! Let’s go up to our room!”

Reesu carried Gale up to room number six. The door was hard to find. It wasn’t between rooms 5 and 7, but Reesu knew how to get there by scent. You turn a few corners and it’s the only door down a longer-than-normal hallway. The windowless passage amplified Reesu’s shadows. She double checked to make sure her tentacles weren’t suddenly visible.

Gale gulped. “Reesu, this hallway no smell nice.”

“You want free clams, don’t you?”

“Yes, this one like clams.”

“And you trust me, right?”

“This one…”

“When have I ever steered you wrong?”

“This one…”

“Trust me, it’ll be fine. You’ll get clams.”

“Ok, this one trust you. For clams.”

“Good.”

They got to the door. It had several cracks and splinters all around it, especially around the edges. Extra boards were nailed to it to reinforce it. The key encountered resistance when pushing it into the lock, as if there was something inside pushing it out. Reesu turned the key, and the door nearly fell off its hinges as it swung open.

Reesu narrowly dodged it, pulling Gale out of the way.

“That door no friendly.”

“It’s ok, Gale.” Reesu walked into the room and plopped Gale onto the bed. “Just wait right here and the clams will be on their way.”

Gale clung to Reesu. “This one no stay unless Reesu also stay.”

“But I… have to use the bathroom.”

“Then this one come with you.”

“Ok, I guess I can hold it in.”

“This room no smell nice. This room smell like death.”

“But doesn’t that smell nice?”

“No.”

=======

Gra and Drathalion arrive in their room and shut the door. Drathalion sits on the bed while Gra takes his armor off. “Ah, that feels nice.”

Drathalion removes the bubble coat. “Yeah, it sure does.”

Gra stared at Drathalion.

“What?”

“Aren’t you going to turn back to normal?”

“This is how I am.”

“No, I mean Astalir.”

Drathalion got up and went to the door. Peaking through it, she scanned the outside of the door. She inserted an onyx stone and the door lock clicked. She tested the door, and it didn’t open.

“Everything ok?”

“Yeah.” Drathalion dropped to all fours and turned into Astalir.

“Astalir!” Gra smiled, arms wide.

“Shh! Not so loud!”

“Oh, sorry.” Gra covered his mouth. “Astalir!” He whispered, reaching down and picking up the deer into a hug. “It’s good to see you buddy!”

Astalir wagged his tail and licked Gra’s arm.

“How are you doing?” Gra held Astalir’s bandaged limb.

“It still hurts. I won’t be able to walk on it for awhile.”

“I’m sorry to hear that, buddy.” Gra pulled out his bag. “Hopefully this will help?”

Astalir’s nostrils clenched shut.

Gra pulled out some berries and held them in his hand.

Astalir glared at Gra. “You’ve been holding out on me?” Astalir licked up a berry.

“I didn’t want to give away your disguise.” Gra petted Astalir’s head. “Plus it’s not the same when you’re disguised. I missed this.”

“Bleat!” was all Astalir could say as he gobbled up the berries.

Gra laughed. “Not so loud, buddy.” Gra stroked Astalir’s fur from his head to his shoulder.

It didn’t take long for Astalir to finish the berries. Once he did, he cuddled up next to Gra on the bed. Gra pulled him under his arm, letting him rest his head in his lap. Gra petted him as he closed his eyes.

“So, when are you going to give it up?”

“What?”

“The disguise?”

“Yeah.”

“Well, I’m injured. Until I’m healed, walking on all fours is difficult.”

“But you don’t need a disguise to walk on two legs.”

“It’d look weird. Would you want to see a weird deer walking on its hind legs? Or would you rather see a beautiful tabaxi?”

“I’d rather see someone I know I can trust.”

“Well I don’t know I can trust.”

“You trust me, don’t you?”

“You’re not the one I don’t trust. You should choose your friends more carefully.”

“Hmm.” Gra nodded. “She’s gotten me out of a lot of tight spots. I bet if you got to know her a bit better, you’d find that, deep down, she has your best interests at heart.”

“Like feeding me deer jerky?”

“Well I’m sure she didn’t mean anything by it.” Gra paused. “But don’t worry. I’ll make sure she doesn’t do anything like that to you again.”

“Promise?”

“Promise.” Gra rubbed his head against Astalir’s. “Now get some sleep, you’ll need your rest for tomorrow’s journey when the blizzard dies down.”

Astalir inhaled, relaxing his head on Gra’s lap. “Bleeeaaaat.” He exhaled.

“Goodnight Astalir.” Gra petted the deer gently until his ears flitted down and his tail flopped onto the bed.

The lizard folk attack and the party finds out what was in the letter they were delivering. Astalir finds out who had hunted down his kind.

# ( 16 ) S2E1: It’s All Fun and Games Until Someone Gets Drunk

Gra’s stomach rumbled as he stroked Astalir’s fur. He was cuddling with him in bed at the inn at Wind’s Crossing, along with Reesu and Gale. After the battle they had just fought, it was nice to spend some quality time with friends, even if those friends were fast asleep.

Astalir’s fur was soft and fluffy for a deer. If there were things hidden in his fur, Gra didn’t feel it. Astalir’s muscles twitched as he petted his back, and he gave a little snort.

Gra’s stomach rumbled. He could eat a whole deer right now. No, not a deer. Well, at least not *this* deer. Gra sat up in bed.

“Something wrong?” Reesu laid on the other side of the bed, holding Gale on her chest. Her hands were at her side, but Gale’s fur still moved as if he was getting pets.

“I’m just hungry, is all.”

“I think I have some meat in the bag…”

“Is it human flesh?”

“Only the very best.”

“I’ll pass.” Gra stood up and got his adventuring gear on.

“Are you going to breakfast? It’s not even dawn yet.”

“I gotta go and… sharpen my weapons.”

“Well I’ll come with you then.”

“No, I’ve got to go alone. I’ll be gone all day probably, and I’ll be going into the woods.”

“But it’s dangerous to go alone!” Reesu held out Gale. “Here, take this.”

Gale woke up. “What? Huh?”

“You want to come with me on a—” Gra looked at Astalir to make sure he was asleep. “A hunting trip?”

“This one will help you.” Gale’s stomach also rumbled. “This one hungry.”

“Come on buddy, let’s go.” Gra picked up Gale and put him on his shoulders.

In the dining room, Gra and Gale found Sui.

“Can’t sleep either?” Gra asked.

“No, not really.” Sui poured a vile of acid into a mug of ale and downed it all in one gulp. “Where you going?”

“Hunting. Wanna come?”

Sui shrugged. “Ok.” He downed one more shot and then readied his bow and arrow.

“Where deer?” Gale asked.

“Astalir’s not coming with us. I don’t think he’d enjoy it.”

“He’s probably not good at hunting anyway.” Sui followed Gra out of the tavern. “At least nowhere near as good as me.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah, I’m the best hunter in the party.”

“That sounds like a challenge.”

“I bet you 10 breakfasts that I can shoot more prey than you.”

“Ha!” Gra chuckled. “And loser has to cook those breakfasts.”

“Deal.” Sui shook hands with Gra as they left the village. “I know you think you got this in the bag, what with you hunting for the kobolds and all, but I’m quite the experienced hunter myself.”

“Oh yeah, the kobolds. I wonder how they’re doing.”

“Probably hanging on to every moment waiting for my return.”

Gra rolled his eyes. He pulled out his bow and shot a rabbit straight in the head. “First one down for me.”

“Gra one, Sui zero!” Gale cheered.

“Yeah, yeah.” Sui grouched. He turned really quick and shot a bush.

“What are you shooting at?”

“I thought I saw a green creature.” Sui jumped in the air and flew to the bush. Behind it, he found the arrow, lying in a pool of blood. A chunk of green skin was impaled on the arrowhead, along with scraps of white cloth. A blood trail followed a pair of boot prints away from the bush.

“What is it?”

“Nothing important.” Sui rejoined Gra and Gale. “Gra one, Sui zero.” He admitted.

They continued hunting.

===

“Hey, Bob, whatcha got there?” Reesu found Bob sitting on his bed, staring at the deck of random oddities.

“Some kind of deck of cards. The dragonborn asked me to hold it.”

“Do you know what it does?”

“Not a clue.”

“Let me show you.” Reesu picked a card. Her skin grew black lines in a webbed steal pattern, and they suck into her skin.

“What happened?”

“I don’t know, but it felt like something good.”

“Smells like the stuff I use to keep the zombies away.” Bob sniffed Reesu’s arm. He shrugged. “Why not?” He pulled a card from the top of the deck. His hand turned to stone, and the petrification crawled up his arm and spread to his whole body in an instant. He was now just a statue on the bed.

“Oh well.” Reesu grabbed the deck of cards, but Bob’s stone fingers held it in place. “Maybe Astalir can get it for me.” Reesu left to go to Gra’s room.

In the hallway, she ran into Captain Johnny. “Is your crew ready to depart?”

“I don’t know. Ask Gra.”

“The big green orc guy?”

“Half-orc, but yes.”

“Where is he?”

Reesu shrugged. “I dunno. Said something about a hunting trip or something.”

Captain Johnny was not amused. “Ok, well tell him I need to speak to him if you see him.”

“No promises.” Reesu waved him off as she entered Gra’s room, looking down at the deer laying in the bed. “Aaastalir…”

Astalir snored. His bandaged leg twitched.

Reesu shook him awake. “Astalir! I want to show you something.”

Astalir woke up. “What is it, Reesu?”

“Come, I want to show you.”

“Hmm… Ok.” Astalir turned into Drathalion and exited the room on two legs.

Reesu showed him to the room.

“Uh, what’s that?” Drathalion walked into the room. “It looks like Bob, but stone. Did you turn him to stone, or is this a statue of Bob?”

“Of course it’s just a statue of Bob. Did you think I’d actually turn someone to stone?”

Drathalion squinted at Reesu, then noticed the deck of cards in the “statue’s” hands, and the one card held by the other stone hand. “Ok, this is definitely Bob but petrified. I don’t know any spells that can do that.”

“Nope, me neither.”

“Did I hear someone say ‘petrified’?” Don appeared out of nowhere. “I know a thing or two about it myself.”

“No, Don, you may not take Bob with you.”

“But he’s dead. A gruesome way to die, I’m afraid.”

“He’s not dead, just petrified.” Reesu corrected.

“Yeah, can you make him unpetrified?” Drathalion asked.

“Yes, of course I can. But for a price.” Don smiled and tapped his fingertips together.

Drathalion rummaged around in her cloak and produced a bag of gold. “Will 100gp do?”

“Ooh goodie!” Don grabbed the bag and listened to the jingle. “Yes, this will do nicely.” Don snapped his fingers and Bob returned to normal.

Bob moaned and held a hand to his head.

“Are you ok?” Drathalion asked.

“I had a weird dream that I was a rock.” Bob responded.

“You were.” Reesu assured.

“Wow.”

A scraping noise from outside startled them. It was getting closer, scaling the wall, like someone was climbing it.

Reesu opened the window from across the room.

They all watched in anticipation as the climbing noise showed itself: a little green goblin with big, floppy ears in a brown leather jacket. He held his chest, where a pool of blood was staining his yellowing white undershirt. He stumbled into the room, landing on his face. As soon as he stood up, he shut the window. His breathing was rapid and frantic. He sat down in the corner, looking up at the window.

Outside, aarakocra patrols flew around, pecking at the windows. They pecked at this window, and after looking inside, they left.

The goblin sighed, taking a few deep breaths.

Reesu approached the goblin. “Are you ok?”

“Gah!” The goblin screamed. He drew a sword and pointed it at Reesu.

“It’s ok, I’m a friend.” Reesu put her palms up. “Are you hurt?”

The goblin nodded. He showed her his chest wound.

“I’ll go get Daisy.” Drathalion bolted down the hallway.

“Ah, you poor thing.” Reesu got in close and wrapped an invisible tentacle around his chest. She applied enough pressure to stop his bleeding. “Don’t worry, little guy. We’ll get you taken care of.”

Daisy came in and healed the goblin up.

“There you go, all better?” Reesu asked.

The goblin nodded.

“What’s your name?”

“Shank.”

“I’m Reesu. This firbolg is Daisy, the tabaxi is Drathalion, and the shadar-kai is Bob.”

“Want some zombie jerky?” Bob offered him some.

“Shank hungry.” Shank took it and bit into it. He immediately regretted it, spitting it all out.

“More for me.” Bob shrugged.

“Shank no like.”

“Shank, you’re so cute!” Reesu smiled. “Can I give you a hug?”

“Shank like hug, Shank like big strong hug.”

“Come here, little guy!” Reesu drew him in and gave him a great big squeezer hug, lifting him off his feet.

“Hey Shank, would you like to draw a card?”

“Shank like cards.”

Reesu handed him the deck.

Shank drew a card, and his legs got thicker. “Whoa! Shank super-fast now!”

Reesu smiled. “I think I’m going to have as much fun with you as I do with Gale.”

“Fun?” Shank pulled out a knife. “Shank like fun. Fun with knives.”

“Aww you got a little knife. I bet you’re really good with that.”

“Shank good.” He pulled out a bigger knife, a sword. “Shank good with big knife too.”

“Really? I’d like to see that.”

Shank stabbed Reesu. “Like that.”

Reesu put an invisible tentacle over the stab wound in her stomach. It hurt, but she was impressed he could strike so quickly. “Wow, that’s very good! How about a duel?”

“Shank no duel child.”

“Come on, I’ll go easy on you.”

Shank looked confused. “No.”

Reesu reached out her arms, and Shank floated in the air. “How about now?”

“Magic girl have magic powers. Shank no like. Shank no duel.”

Reesu put him down. “It would’ve been boring anyway. You wouldn’t have been able to do anything.”

“Little girl friendly. Shank no want hurt little girl.”

“Ah, no worries.” Don appeared behind Shank, arm around his shoulder. “I have cream pies.”

“Who?” Shank spun around, drawing his sword.

“My cream pies heal you to full health. I will sponsor this duel with free cream pies.”

“Why?”

“If you are to be a party, you must know each other’s strengths, *and* weaknesses. What better way than with a duel? Haha.” Don splashed a pie on Reesu’s face, and her wound healed instantly.

Drathalion peeked her head out of the room. “You’re doing this for your own entertainment, aren’t you?”

“Well, not only.” Don pondered. “Now, let’s all go outside where there’s more room!”

“Hold on. He’s not in our party.” Drathalion pointed out.

“Well he could be.” Reesu looked Shank in the eyes. “Do you want to be in our party Shank?”

“Shank like be in party.”

“Welcome aboard!” Reesu hugged him.

“Alright, let’s see what you can do.” Drathalion agreed.

Don led them out to the shooting range.

At this time of day, it was empty, save for one robot who was shooting targets.

Shank walked onto the range, admiring his expertise. “Who that?”

“That’s Silber. You don’t want to get hit by one of his bullets.”

“Silber. Silber strong warrior. Shank like Silber. Shank want to be strong warrior. Strong warrior like Silber. Silber train Shank?”

“Let’s not bother the robot.” Drathalion said. But before she did, Shank was gone.

Shank’s extra thick legs carried him all the way to Silber’s position before anyone even noticed. When he got there, he watched the robot line up a shot, shoot, and explode a target almost half a mile down range.

“Whoa! Silber shoot well! Silber so cool!”

Silber glanced at Shank, and then refocused on his target practice.

“Silber teach Shank how to be strong warrior?”

“I don’t do teaching.” Silber lined up another shot.

“Silber duel Shank?”

“What’s in it for me?”

Don appeared. “I’ll give 4 magic bullets.”

“What are you doing here?” Silber pointed his laser eye at Don.

“Can’t a being just be happy to see his friends duking it out in a duel?”

“We’re not friends. But, ok… 6 bullets.”

“Deal.”

Drathalion and the party caught up and watched the two get ready. Drathalion molded the earth to make waist-high walls around the two, making a small arena. Shank could easily run from one side of it to the other in the amount of time it took Silber to load his gun.

“Fighters ready!” Don announced. “Fight!”

Silber took a shot at Shank, hitting him in the leg. His leg gushed out blood, but Shank didn’t pay any attention to it.

He lunged at Silber, knocking him down. Shank pulled out three separate swords and buried them deep into the grooves between Silber’s platings. Sparks flew out as Silber’s limbs failed.

Silber dropped his gun onto his foot, which was the only functioning limb he had left. He lifted his leg and pointed the gun straight at Shank’s chest, and remote activated the trigger. The bullet tore through Shank, echoing as it flew off into the distance.

Shank staggered and fell over backwards, unconscious.

“Winner: Silber!” Don appeared next to Silber and raised his non-functioning arm. Then he threw a cream pie in Silber’s face and another onto Shank.

Silber got up and grabbed his gun, dusting it off. When Shank also stood up, he smirked. “I gotta hand it to you, kid, you’re a lot tougher than I thought you would be.”

“Silber agrees to teach Shank?”

“I don’t know. I think you’re a pretty strong warrior already.”

“Shank must get stronger.”

“And why’s that?”

“To teach other goblins to be strong.”

===

Don leaned over and whispered to Drathalion. “Please, step into my office.” He snapped his fingers and a rectangular portal opened to a private interior room.

“Whatever for?”

“To discuss the ‘gold’ you gave me.”

Drathalion’s eyes went wide, and she obliged.

Inside, the walls were curved in wild ways, the floor bulged in random places, and the furniture walked around on four legs. Bookcases phased in and out like bubbles.

“What is this place?”

“My home.” Don smiled. “Like it?”

“You’ve got a lot of books.”

“Yes.” Don’s demeanor turned sour. “And you’ve got a lot of nerve, paying me with rocks.” He held out the bag of gold that Drathalion had given him earlier, showing her that it was all rocks.

“That’s not the bag I gave you.”

“It is. And it has rocks in it.”

“Well, it’s not my fault you turned the gold into rocks.”

“Drathalion, Drathalion.” Don shook his head. “Or should I say, Astalir?” He snapped his fingers, and Astalir’s disguise disappeared.

Astalir’s ears pinned back, and he backed up into a wall.

“I like a good amount of chaos and pranks, as much as anyone.” Don got up into Astalir’s face, showing him a glimpse of his true form: a blue curly, crooked horn and a spiky white antler. “If you ever give me rocks again, it won’t be the gold I’ll petrify. Understand?”

Astalir gulped, but nodded, nonetheless.

“Now, I am inclined to forgive you, *this* time.”

Astalir spotted a bookshelf phasing in. On it were two books with covers made of deer hide. He flicked his eyes on them for a moment to get a lock on, and lit up the tips of his antlers to grab them from afar.

“But…” Discord continued. “You’ll have to do something for me.”

“Yes?” Astalir made eye contact to distract Don from the floating books. The books floated under the moving furniture and along the wavy floor towards Astalir.

“Win a duel. To the death. With one of your party members.”

“But… I don’t want to kill…”

“It’s ok. I’ll just throw a pie in their face, they’ll be fine.”

The books were creeping up behind Don now. “And if I refuse to fight?”

“Well, then I just might turn you to stone for… 4 months? Is that long enough?” Don ran a finger down Astalir’s antlers, tine to base.

Astalir’s mouth opened wide. By the time he would come out of it, his antlers would be getting ready to fall off. Then he would have to wait a whole year before continuing his mission. “Who am I fighting?”

“Your choice. Better choose wisely.”

Astalir brought the book between Don’s legs. If he can thread them through just right, he can take them without Don ever seeing…

Don snapped his fingers, and the books appeared in front of him. “You seem to be interested in these two books in particular.”

Astalir stared at him and the books.

“Hmmm…” Don smiled. “I’ll give you the books, but for your attempted theft, I’ll take away your mouth.” Don snapped his fingers.

Astalir opened his mouth to speak, but his jaw moved up and his lips sealed shut. For good measure, his tongue also fused into his teeth, which also fused together. His lips squirmed uncomfortably.

“I seem to recall that folks around here require the use of their vocal cords to cast spells. But you’re not a spellcaster, *are* you?” Don chuckled evilly. “You’re a rogue, right? Hopefully you don’t rely on your mouth for spells, otherwise you’re going to be spending the rest of your antlers’ life as a statue.” He cackled.

He gave Astalir the books and gave him back his Drathalion disguise. He opened the portal back to Wind’s Crossing, and they both exited.

“Now, who are you going to fight?”

Drathalion looked at Reesu. No, she would grapple her before she ever got close. Silber? She’d never get close enough to him. Shank was a wild card, and based on his battle with Silber, he was on the higher end. Gale would do nicely; he’d let her win probably. But he wasn’t here. That left only one option.

Drathalion pointed at Bob.

“Bob! The shadar kai! Drathalion challenges you to a duel.” Don announced.

Bob shrugged. “Ok.”

They climbed into the arena walls.

“Hey, if I kill you, don’t take it personal, ok?” Bob casually let out.

Drathalion nodded, unable to speak.

“Fighters ready!” Don chuckled, fingers touching. “Fight!”

“Do we have to?” Bob hugged himself.

Drathalion drew her bow.

Bob shrugged. “Ok.” Before Drathalion could unleash her arrow, Bob dashed to her and swiped her with his shortsword.

Drathalion dodged but got slashed in the side. She split in two, flanking Bob from both sides. She loosed her arrow, which cut across Bob’s arm.

Bob spun and threw daggers at both Drathalions, hitting them both square in the chest. “I don’t want to fight anymore.” He took out a bag of baked crispy potatoes and ate one.

Drathalion snook up behind him and daggered him. He caught the blade with his bag of potatoes and shoved Drathalion. Then, with his sword, he plunged it into Drathalion’s chest.

Drathalion rolled, catching only the side of the blade, getting a large gash in her side. She held her wound while drawing her rapier.

“Yay! Go Drathalion!” Reesu cheered.

Drathalion looked at Reesu, and at the waist-high wall in front of her. She pointed a finger at the wall, and Reesu looked down.

*HELP ME*

“Shank, do you want to jump in?” Reesu drew Shank close, already lifting him up.

“Shank fight! Shank fight!”

Reesu threw Shank up into the air, and he crashed down in front of Bob, was getting ready to shoot an arrow. Bob shot Shank in the arm.

Shank went full force on Bob, showing just how strong of a warrior he was already. He slashed Bob with each of his “big knives”, pinning him to the ground. “You not strong warrior. You have nothing to teach Shank.”

“Where’d you come from?” Bob looked in shock, skewered on multiple blades.

Drathalion made a hand gesture, and a stalagmite erupted out of the ground, piercing Bob’s heart.

Bob’s head hung limp from his neck.

Drathalion lowered her bow, staring at Don, arms high.

Don grinned ear to ear, waving a finger.

Drathalion went on alert. The goblin was in the ring with her, and it wasn’t stopping.

“Shank fight!” He pulled his big knives out of Bob one by one.

That bought Drathalion enough time to pour some arrows into Shank. Three, to be exact.

But Shank was unphased. He ran at Drathalion with full force.

Drathalion’s split into two.

Shank stabbed a Drathalion, and his sword went right through it. He ran to the other one and stabbed it with his longest knife.

Drathalion drew her dagger, but she was skewered to a wall, and couldn’t reach Shank. She touched the wall, and the stone around the sword withdrew, allowing her to get free. She dodged to the side, avoiding another blade, and grew a wall out of the ground to block Shank from stabbing her.

“Hey! That’s cheating!” Reesu exclaimed. “How dare you wall in front of my dog’s face!”

“Yeah, what she said.” A beer-wielding Aarakocra named Lor-Tay stood on the sidelines next to Reesu. “How does she even have that? She doesn’t look like a spellcaster.”

Reesu leaned over and explained it to him. It took a whole 5 minutes of commenting on the battle.

During which, Drathalion was holding on. She was badly wounded, but still breathing. She held her palms open behind her, and a bright sphere of white light appeared behind her.

Shank easily got around the wall, and when he did, he was blinded by the white light.

Drathalion took the opportunity to shoot more arrows into him, but he didn’t go down. It doesn’t help that she missed a few shots.

But now he knew where she was. He jumped at her, knocking her to the ground. With a final frenzy of blows, all his blades were making themselves at home in her chest.

Finally, Drathalion passed out: the ball of light faded, the walls came down, and the writing withered away. Only the cat remained.

Don walked up to Shank, raising his blood-soaked arm into the air. “Winner: Shank!”

“Shank fight! Shank fight!”

“No, Shank, you fought already. Time to calm down.” Reesu pulled him in, restraining him.

Don threw pies on Drathalion, Bob, and Shank. He helped Drathalion to her feet. “Hello. Are you ready to be turned to stone?” He snapped his fingers, opening her mouth up again.

“But I won.”

“You were defeated.”

“But I won the duel between me and Bob.”

“Sorry, but no, Shank finished him.”

Drathalion held out a hand, casting swirling lights from them. The lights danced about, slowly coming together, forming a coherent image. “No, watch this.”

The image was of Bob being impaled on Shank’s blades. Just as Shank was about to stab him with his dagger, a thin spike of earth shot up and finished Bob off first.

“I got the last hit.”

“Hmmm…” Don pondered. “So you did.” He laughed. “You cheated, but in a chaotic way.” He tapped his chin. “I like that. Very well, you will not be turned to stone. *This* time. But never pull that trick on me again, understood.”

Drathalion nodded.

“It’s unclassy to use the same trick twice.”

“So, who’s thirsty?” Reesu asked. “Let’s go get some drinks!”

===

Shank tries to befriend Silber, but Silber says he only accepts “friends” that are useful to him. Shank tells Silber he will try to be useful to him.

The party goes to the tavern.

Reesu takes a sip of her endless bottle of alcohol before ordering a bottle of a stronger drink from the bar.

Shank ordered a glass of milk.

The rest of the party went upstairs to sleep, saying goodnight as they passed by.

When it was just Reesu and Shank left at the bar, Reesu opened her bottle. “Shank, would you like some alcohol?”

“Captain says no trouble. Captain and Shank leave soon to boat.”

“Oh, come on! One little sip won’t hurt you.”

“Shank must sleep soon.”

“You want to be a strong warrior, right? Alcohol is what strong warriors drink.”

Shank looked at the bottle. “Ok, Shank take sip.”

“Alriiight!” The bottle poured itself into a glass. “Drink up!”

Shank downed it, and wheezed a little.

“So? You like it?”

Shank nodded. “Shank like.”

“How about something stronger?” Reesu waved down the bartender. “What’s your strongest drink?”

“Shank no want.”

“But you want to be a strong warrior, right? So then you must drink the strongest drink.”

“Hmmm… Shank agree.”

“Bartender, strongest drink!”

The aarakocra behind the bar spoke in clicks and whistles, cleaning a glass.

Reesu made an illusion of a mug of ale, but then increased its size.

The aarakocra chirped, holding up a super-sized mug.

Reesu shook her head. She added strong arms to the side of the illusory mug.

The aarakocra scratched its head.

Then the doors to the tavern opened, and in walked Drathalion.

“Drathalion! How good of you to join us!” Reesu cheered.

Drathalion looked pensive as she approached the bar and claimed a stool across the bar from Reesu.

The aarakocra bartender chirped.

Drathalion chirped back, pointing to some Aarakocran symbols that just appeared on the counter.

The bartender nodded and brought Drathalion some berry juice.

“Where was that?” Reesu asked.

Drathalion shrugged. “In the back, I guess.”

“You can speak Aarakocran?”

Drathalion squawked, whistled, and cawed.

The bartender gave her a quizzical glance.

“I’ll take that as a yes.” Reesu smiled. “Can you order us a drink?”

“I’m not buying you anything.”

I mean, can you translate for me?”

Drathalion shrugged. “Ok.”

“Great! Can you ask what the strongest drink they have is?”

Drathalion chirped, pointing again to a new writing on the counter.

The bartender squawked, getting excited.

“Something called the Wind Twister. 96% alcohol apparently.”

“Oohoohoo!” Reesu cheered. “Yes! Order us that.”

Drathalion nodded at the bartender and chirped.

The bartender obliged, giving Reesu a special twisted shot glass for the drink.

“Ok, Shank, drink up!” She slid it over to the goblin.

“Shank taste first.”

“No, strongest warriors drink strongest shot all at once.”

“Shank be like strongest warriors. Shank drink.” Shank did just that. He took the whole shot glass and poured it straight down his throat. He coughs for a little bit. “Shank strong?”

“Good job, Shank! You’re learning!” Reesu hugged him from the side.

Across the bar, Drathalion’s ears and whiskers drooped, and she hung her head close to the counter.

“You look down, cat.”

“I can’t find Gra, Gale, or Sui.” Drathalion looked up at Reesu. “Do you know where they are?”

“On a hiking trip.” Reesu shrugged.

“But why did they go without me?”

“Like I told you, he went on a hiking trip.”

“Did he tell you where he was going? It’s not like him to leave me behind like this.”

“I’m sure he’ll be back. Say, how about a drink? Perhaps it’ll cheer you up?”

“I got one already, thanks.” Drathalion raised her glass.

Reesu whistled at the bartender. She held up a coin as she pointed at a certain bottle on the wall.

The bartender held it up and clicked.

Reesu nodded.

The bartender collected the coin and granted the alcoholic beverage.

Reesu slid it over to Drathalion. “Drink up, it’s on me.”

“Reesu, I’m not in the mood for your… pranks.”

“It’s not a prank, deer. This is genuinely to help you feel better.”

Drathalion looked skeptical, but considered it anyway. “What is it?”

“It’s an apple cider.”

She sniffed it. “Thanks, but I don’t drink.”

“At least take a sip?”

“Fine.” Drathalion raised the glass to her lips and let a small droplet enter. Her face contorted, brows furrowed and whiskers sticking straight out. She quickly took another sip of the berry juice.

“So?”

“No, I don’t like it.”

“Well, you have to drink the whole thing for it to help you feel better.”

“I don’t want to.”

“Trust me.”

Drathalion squinted at Reesu, while covering the glass with her arms. A minute later, Drathalion took the glass, full of liquid, and drank the whole thing. Strangely, the liquid was very silent as the cat swallowed.

“Nice try, deer.” Reesu peaked around the bar and found a floating pool of cider just under the countertop. She waved her hand, and the alcohol floated up to Drathalion’s mouth.

Drathalion closed her mouth, letting the alcohol sting her face instead. “Reesu! I don’t like it!” But opening her mouth to speak was a mistake, as she gave Reesu an opening to force it all down her throat.

“There, feel better?”

Drathalion snorted, like a deer would. She coughed a little.

“There you go.”

“How does that solve anything?”

“It helps take your mind off things.”

“But I’m still thinking about it.”

“Well let’s distract you, then.” Reesu ordered 3 empty glasses and poured ale from her endless bottle into all of them. “Let’s play a game.”

“If it’s about staying dry, I’m pretty sure I’ll win.”

Reesu laughed. “Well, it is, but not that kind of dry.”

“Shank like game. Shank want to play.”

“It’s the game where someone asks a question, and then we all drink. Then after the question is answered, someone else asks a question.”

“Sounds like the only end result is getting drunk.” Drathalion noted.

“Exactly!” Reesu raised her glass. “Now, who wants to go first?”

“Shank ask you, girl.”

“That’s a shot.” Reesu took a shot, and so did Shank. “Drathalion?”

She rolled her eyes, and then took her shot.

“Ok, what’s your question?”

“Reesu is child?”

“I’m the height of a child.” Reesu gave them all more ale. “Ok, I got a question. Shot!”

They all took a shot.

“Shank, what brought you here? To Wind’s Crossing?”

“Yeah,” Drathalion added, “What’s a goblin doing this far out?”

“Shank here with Captain. Shank want to get strong to protect goblins. Shank teach goblins how to fight. Goblins protect self goblins.”

“Any reason why?” Reesu took a sip straight from her bottle.

“Shank shamed.” He hung his head. “Shank couldn’t protect family. Family killed. Mother, father, brothers…”

“Sorry to hear that.” Reesu burped. “My parents are also dead.”

Drathalion nodded. “My parents are…” She stopped herself.

“Yes?” Reesu inquired.

“I got a question.” Drathalion changed the subject.

“Shot!” They all took a shot.

Drathalion started wobbling like a loose plate of gelatin. “Do you know who killed your family?”

Shank hung his head. “Shank no like talk.”

“Ok, we can drop it.”

“Shank have question.”

“Shot!” They all took another shot. With each one, Shank and Drathalion got visibly drunker, but Reesu seemed unphased.

“How Reesu meet Drathalion and Bob?”

“Oh, how did the party get together?” Reesu looked at the ceiling. “I saved a deer from drowning in a river.”

“Ha!” Drathalion chuckled. “I knew that was you, ‘New Gra’. You didn’t fool me.”

Reesu chuckled.

“I’ve been here… the whooole time. We met Daisy in Canadia, Bob in… The Sticky Bucket?”

“No, we met Bob in some weird graveyard.”

“Oh, that’s right, the night I went off on my own.”

“Yeah.”

“We met Reesu when she saved us from the bears, and… what? No. You didn’t save me from the river, Gra did.”

“How do you know?”

Both Shank and Drathalion gave Reesu tilted-head confused looks.

“Anyway, we met Gale in the kobold cave, and we recruited Gra just before.” Drathalion burped, and her ears got abnormally large. “And Sui and I, we raided a minotaur’s maze with a whooole other party. And then before meeting Gra, we raided a goblin camp.”

“Goblin camp?” Shank could barely keep his head up straight.

“Yeah. I wanted to find out what the goblins knew, and tricked Sui into going to the goblin camp. I thought he’d just hooold them off, but he annihilated them. I think one escaped.”

Shank, as green as he was, grew red in the face. “This goblin, he have brown leather jacket?”

Drathalion pondered. “I think so.”

“And white undershirt?”

“Probably.”

“Purple pants?”

“Most definitely.”

Shank jumped up on the counter, his short stature letting him stand full height without hitting the ceiling. He was scowling at the cat.

Drathalion squinted at Shank. He was wearing a brown leather jacket, a white undershirt, and purple pants. “Wow, you look just like him!”

“I is him!” Shank pulled out his shortsword and jumped across the counter at Drathalion.

Drathalion duplicated herself, but fell off the stool onto the floor.

Shank’s blade plunged into the clone’s heart and got stuck in the stool beneath. The clone wavered and wobbled.

“Ok! I see everyone’s had enough to drink!” Reesu reached out with invisible tentacles, grabbing both Shank and Drathalion. She squeezed them both until they both dropped unconscious. Drathalion’s disguise fell away, and she returned to being Astalir.

Shank hiccupped, barfing little bits of vomit onto Reesu’s tentacles. Astalir drooled out of his mouth.

“Well, I’ve learned waaay too much tonight. Let’s call it a night.” She turned to the bartender. “You got any super glue?”

He chirped.

Reesu asked with an illusion, and the bartender obliged, for some extra coin, of course. Reesu took the glue into Gra’s room and set the two would-be combatants up into their positions. She stood Astalir up on four legs up against the wall near the window, gluing all four hooves to the floor. Then she rotated his head 90 degrees so it faced the wall, stuck his antlers in, and glued them there.

Astalir snored, and his tail twitched.

“Deer are like horses, right? They sleep standing up?” Reesu patted Astalir’s head. “You should be comfy there, deer.”

Astalir slumped over, bumping his butt into the wall. His legs buckled and his body was being held up largely by his head.

“I’m sure that’s normal.”

Reesu grabbed Shank by the feet and put him upside-down in a barrel, then glued a lid on it. The lid had a hole in it with just enough room for Shank to peak his head through, if he so decided. And Reesu made that decision for him. She then turned the barrel upright and glued it to the wall opposite Astalir, taking care to make sure Shank was also facing the wall.

“Goodnight deer, goodnight my pet.” She kissed both of them on the forehead. “Please forget everything that happened tonight. And sweet dreams!”

# ( 17 ) S2E2: Headaches

*SPPPLUUURT*

Waking up with a burning throat and a putrid taste in his mouth, Astalir spat out the remaining puke mucus in his mouth. His right front hoof was now wet, but at least his stomach was feeling better, although emptier.

Pain clouded his mind as his eyes winced in pain. His foggy memory was clearing up, but he still couldn’t remember what happened last night, or where he was.

Astalir opened his eyes and saw a wooden wall. The shadow of his face fell upon the left side. He was leaning his head up against the wall. He pulled away, but his antlers wouldn’t move. Did he get them stuck in the wall? How could he have shoved his antlers into the wall with such force as to cause them to get stuck like this?

He tried again, but no luck. He could feel that his antlers were losing integrity with each pull, so elected to stop trying.

This pose wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t turning his head 90 degrees at an awkward angle. He lifted a hoof up to move. Nope, he didn’t. His hooves all stuck into the ground, unable to move.

AST: “What kind of dark magic is this?!” He spat.

RSU: “Ah, I see you’re awake.”

“Reesu?”

“Good morning sunshine.”

“What happened? Why am I stuck in the wall?”

“You don’t remember?”

Astalir moaned, eyes wincing. “Uh… I remember… drinking… playing a drinking game with you and Shank. Oh no…” Astalir let out a long, regretful bellow. “Did I get drunk with you guys?”

“You did, I didn’t.”

“I should’ve known.”

“Yeah, it was pretty stupid. But fun.”

“So this was your doing?”

“I’ll neither confirm nor deny.”

Astalir sighed. “Can you just get me out?”

“Mmm…” Reesu took a swig of her endless bottle of ale. “Nope!”

“Why not?”

“It’s fun to watch you struggle.”

“Well don’t get comfy. I’m not going to be here very long.”

“Wanna bet?”

“No.” Astalir jostles around, trying to free his hooves. All he manages to do is make a lot of noise bumping into the wall.

*KNOCK KNOCK*

“Gra?” Astalir’s ears perk up. “Oh good, finally!”

“Is there a zombie party going on in there?”

“Oh no, Booob…” Astalir rolled his eyes. “Go away, Bob.”

“Bob!” Reesu looked at the door and it popped open. She greeted the shadar kai with a smile. “Do you like to drink?” She patted the seat next to her on the bed, holding out the ale bottle.

Bob shrugged. “Sure. Whatcha got?” Bob took the ale bottle and wheezed. “That’s some \*cough\* good stuff.”

“Bob! No! It’s a trick!” Astalir wiggled around.

“Who said that?”

“Me. Over here. Stuck on the wall.” Astalir flapped his ears annoyedly.

Bob’s eyes went wide as he stared down at the bottle. “That’s some *really* strong stuff.” He nodded at Reesu.

“Have a seat. I’m watching the deer get himself unstuck.”

Bob shrugged. “Why not.” He took another swig before Reesu grabbed it back.

Astalir struggled a little bit, but no luck.

“Keep trying.” Reesu teased.

Astalir tried forcing his hoof out, but it didn’t budge. He rested a minute, and in the quiet, he realized he had to relieve himself. And that gave him an idea. He urinated right in the room, right in front of Reesu and Bob.

Reesu chuckled.

Astalir’s antlers glowed, and the pee never hit the floor. Instead, it collected into a floating bubble just under his belly. Once he finished relieving himself, the pee bubble flowed down to his hoof and worked itself into the glue.

“Nice try, but that glue’s been dry for hours.”

“I just gotta wait for the piss to dissolve the glue.”

“I don’t think that’s how it works.”

Astalir struggled a little more. “Reesu! When I get out, I’m going to poke so many antler holes in that smug face of yours!” He managed to get his front right hoof free. It seems the pee might have actually helped a little.

Reesu took a sip of ale, and Bob took a sip of ale.

Astalir’s ears flipped. He settled down and got real quiet. He held his breath.

Reesu put the bottle to her mouth, and the swashing of the liquid caught Astalir’s attention. His ear flicked to the sound of the bottle. Reesu froze in position, and grabbed Bob with an invisible tentacle to keep him quiet too. Her eyebrows were lifted, and her lips were pursed.

Astalir grunted after a few minutes, and his ears flitted down. “Reesu, why did you do this?” He raised his ears again and calmed his breathing.

Reesu, instead of saying anything, held out a finger and wiggled it at the wall in front of Astalir. *Because it’s fun.*

Astalir snorts, but otherwise stays quiet.

Reesu doesn’t dare move, and she doesn’t let Bob move either. For a whole half hour, the trio are stuck in a quiet game standoff.

The one to finally break the silence was Captain Johnny, who burst into the room.

Astalir disguised himself as a dresser.

“There you are.” Johnny intruded. “I’ve been looking all over for you—wait, why is the goblin glued to the wall?”

“He’s got a hangover, don’t touch him.” Reesu moved Johnny with an invisible tentacle. “Here, stand in front of this elegant dresser and admire it.”

Johnny glanced at it, but then addressed Reesu. “Yes, it’s nice. But I got a ship to get back to. And my passengers are still not ready.”

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll wake everyone up soon and we’ll meet you downstairs.”

“But—”

Reesu lifted Johnny up, covered his mouth, and floated him silently to the door, which shut itself in Johnny’s face. Reesu stared the dresser down. “Such a lovely dresser, isn’t it?”

The dresser disappeared, revealing the deer again. The piss pool floated up to Reesu’s face.

“Isn’t it, *captain*?” Reesu said to no one in particular.

“Yes, it is.” Reesu said in Captain Johnny’s voice.

The piss pool retreated back under Astalir.

Bob grabbed the ale and took a swig. “Ah, that’s good.” He burped. “This reminds me of the time my buddy got stuck headfirst in a barrel. He rolled himself down a hill and he still didn’t get unstuck. In the end, he did manage to free himself, but he had to use a hammer to break his antler tines off. Made some nice zombie knives out of them afterwards.” He took another swig.

Astalir tensed up: ears folded back, shoulders raised high, and tail tucked between his legs. He didn’t want to have to destroy his antlers to get out. Astalir took a deep breath and sighed. “Ok Reesu, what’s it going to take for you to get me out of here?”

*10 minutes*. The text appeared on the wall.

“10 minutes? Really, that’s it? Ok. I can wait.”

*On one condition.*

“Oh yeah? What’s that?”

*When you snoop around,* the text faded to give way to new text, *You let me in the know on anything you find.*

Astalir grumbled. “My quest is rather… confidential. And personal.”

*What’ll it be?*

“Ok, fine. I’ll let you know *some* of the things I find.”

*Deal.*

“Ok, get me out.”

*In 10 minutes.*

Astalir sighed. He pawed the ground with his one free hoof for 10 minutes.

After the time had passed, invisible tentacles wrapped around his stomach, his feet, and his antlers.

“Please be careful! I don’t want my antlers to break!” Astalir almost sobbed.

“Don’t worry, I’m careful.” Reesu tugged in one big motion, breaking Astalir free from the wall and floor all at once.

Astalir wobbled around in a daze for a bit, getting his bearings. His antlers had wood chips stuck on them, and wood splinters clung to his hooves. He locked eyes with Reesu. “Hey Reesu.”

“Yeah?”

Astalir’s antlers glowed, and his pool of piss pressurized and released straight at Reesu. She shut her mouth, but still took it in the face. Meanwhile, Astalir ran to the window. It opened itself, and the ground below rose up with subtle tremors that shook the glass in the opening windowpanes. Astalir jumped out, rode the earth column to the ground, and ran off.

Reesu took back the ale bottle and dumped it all over her face.

“What are you doing?” Bob asked.

“Getting reindeer piss off me.”

“Oh…” Bob’s face contorted. “Wait, that’s not what I was drinking out of that flask, was it?”

“Yeah, sure, I have a flask of endless reindeer piss.”

Bob stared drunkenly at the floor, wide-eyed. “Well it was pretty good, for reindeer piss.”

Reesu facepalmed.

Outside, Gra is coming back from his hunting trip. He came into Wind’s Crossing with a cart full of lizard skins and pelts of small mammals. Sui and Gale followed him. Sui was pulling the cart.

“This thing is getting heavy.” Sui complained. “Can you take a turn pulling it?”

“We had a bet and you lost. Besides, we’re almost there.” Gra patted him on the back.

Gra stopped and addressed an aarakocra staring at them. “Hello, do you know where we can sell our game?”

The aarakocra spoke in Aarakocran, but nonetheless pointed to a row of buildings with other merchants.

Gra nodded. “Thank you.”

“Ohoho!” Don JeLancie appeared, blocking Gra’s path to the market. “Are you selling?”

“Move, these aren’t for you.”

“How rude!” Don huffed. “Well, if who am I to say who you can sell to.”

“Why do you want them so bad?”

“Oh look! Your friend is waving you down. Tata now!” Don disappeared.

Gra turned around to see Reesu running up to him from the tavern.

“Gra! You’re back!”

“Hi Reesu. How have things been here?”

“Good. Nothing weird happened.”

Gra squinted. “What weird thing happened?”

“Nothing.”

“No, no… I know you Reesu. You wouldn’t say that if nothing really *did* happen.”

“I adopted a pet.”

“What kind of pet?”

“A goblin pet!”

“A goblin… pet?” Gra’s eyebrows furrowed. “I thought Goblins were humanoids?”

“Eh, who knows. But I got one.”

“Oh no. Don’t you remember what happened to the last pet?”

“That wasn’t my fault! You petted it too hard! Poor Henry…”

“His bones were fragile because someone didn’t feed him properly.”

“And who was supposed to get the food?”

Gra grumbled. “I’m not rehashing this. Show me your new pet.”

“This one want to see! This one hopes is cute bunny.” Gale followed.

“She already said it was a goblin.” Sui scoffed.

“What was it gobbling? This one thinks has carrots.”

Sui rolled his eyes, and followed along.

“Hey Sui, keep pulling that cart!” Gra called out. “The market’s right over there. And it’s not a bunny, sorry Gale.”

“Oh. This one disappoint. But will sell pelts for Gra.”

“Thanks buddy.”

Sui and Gale went to the market to sell the pelts while Reesu showed Gra up to the room.

Gra’s jaw drops as soon as he enters the room. “Reesu!”

“What?”

“Why is there a goblin glued to the *wall*?”

“He wants to be friends with Silber.”

“Ok, that’s weird, but… that doesn’t explain anything.” Gra looked around the room. Bits of wood were chipped out of the wall and floor by the window. “And why is there damage over here?”

“Ok, you might want to sit down for this.” Reesu sat on the bed and dragged Gra down next to her. “It concerns our friendly neighborhood deer.”

“Ok, I’m listening.”

Reesu tells Gra about the drinking game, and why Shank wants to get strong, and what Astalir said about raiding a goblin camp with Sui.

“You’re kidding.” Gra groaned. “You got Astalir drunk?”

“The good news is that neither of them will remember spilling the beans! So Shank won’t try to spill Astalir’s guts!”

“This is not good. You cannot keep him.”

“I can and I will.”

“He’s a threat to Astalir and Sui. We can’t have him around.”

“Well, only a threat to Sui. He doesn’t remember Astalir from the incident.”

“But still, we can’t have him causing chaos among us.”

“But I want to keep him.” Reesu leaned up against Gra, clasped her hands together, opened her eyes wide, and gave him a big pouty face. “Pweeease?”

Gra rolled his eyes and looked at Shank. “I don’t know.”

“Pwetty pwease?”

Gra rubbed his forehead. “Well, I guess the kobold cave *does* need one of us to check in on them. This mission is taking longer than exp—”

“Oh thank you! Thank you!” Reesu gave Gra a big ole’ squeeze hug, popping his eyes halfway out.

“But you have to tell Sui.”

“Ok, I will.”

Reesu wrote a note and stuck it to Sui’s door, *Goodbye. -Gra*

===

Downstairs, Gra finds Captain Johnny. “Hello.”

“Gra, I’ve been looking for you. Are you ready to depart?”

Gra looked around. He found Gale, Bob, and Jodi. Reesu was holding Shank. Silber was waiting patiently in the corner of the bar. He didn’t see Sui, but left him out of the count on purpose. “Yeah, I think so.”

“Excellent. Let’s head to the docks. It’s all the way back in Canadia.”

The party prepares to leave, but before they get out of Wind’s Crossing, Revali stops them.

“Halt!” Revali grabbed Silber by the arm. “I won’t let you pass until we have a rematch.”

“As acting sheriff of Wind’s Crossing,” Silber said without even turning around, “You have no authority to stop me.”

“Ok, you’re right. But we have to have a rematch.”

“You’re not good enough for a rematch.”

“I will triumph no matter how long it takes.”

“Then wait 16 years, 5 months, 13 days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, and 12 seconds.”

Revali let go, stunned.

The party left without any further trouble.

===

After Astalir jumped out of the window, he went to a nearby stream to wash off the glued-on wood chips. He managed to chip the wood some more, but there were several bits that wouldn’t come off. He sighed in exasperation.

Several shadows from above coalesced around him. He looked up. He was being circled by a choir of robed aarakocras, chanting something unfamiliar.

His antlers flickered with runes, and his ears pricked. Now the birds’ chanting was telligible.

“Lonesome prize, easy goal. Leaving is for fools. Lonesome prize, easy goal. Leaving is for fools.” They chanted over and over again, as they descended around him.

Astalir licked his nose as he locked eyes with the bird in the fanciest robe, which had gold trim.

As they chanted, they got closer. Astalir watched as they did, not seeing any way out of it. Then he noticed that one of the birds was carrying a wet cloth, with a fowl smelling chemical on it. His eyebrows raised. His antlers flickered, and made an invisible move that produced a cloth ripping sound.

The birds stopped chanting. The bird carrying the cloth looked at it, but it was still intact.

Astalir made the cloth ripping sound again, but this time he lifted his tail and clenched his butt cheeks.

“Lonesome prize hard to find. Some are myths, most are lies. Lonesome prize hard to find. Some are myths most are lies.”

“Lonesome prize”? Were they referring to him? Are they referring to him being the last of his kind? Do they know something he doesn’t know? Do they know if he really is the last one? Astalir bravely faced the birds, making no move to threaten them.

The birds closed in, and the bird holding the cloth grabbed Astalir’s muzzle and shoved the cloth over Astalir’s muzzle.

Astalir exhaled and clothed his eyes, and let his limbs go limp. Sharp talons grabbed his legs and antlers, and dug into his stomach. Astalir let out a squeal, but quickly held it in. He peeked open his eyes as they carried him into the sky. They were taking him to the shooting range.

From his vantage point, Astalir could see the party leaving the town. And Revali was with them, completely on the other side of town from Revali’s house. Astalir smiled briefly.

The birds dropped him off behind a hill, where you couldn’t see from the shooting range. They placed him in a snow mound while they cleaned the snow off a round stone altar. They placed him on the altar and began chanting. One of them pulled out a dagger and wiped it with his robe.

Astalir’s eyes went wide. His antlers glowed iridescent, he jumped into the air above the birds, and landed gracefully in the snow behind them, running away.

“Catch him! He must not escape!” The bird leader yelled. The birds all chased the deer behind a hill, where the deer found himself in a dead end. The deer turned around, and threatened to charge, thrashing his antlers forward.

One brave bird flew up over the deer, landed behind it, and grabbed its muzzle. The bird’s hands went right through the deer’s face.

The birds all gasped in shock. “It’s fake!” They turned back to the altar, where deer tracks trailed off in the opposite direction, before ending altogether in the middle between two hills. The birds all stood in shock.

Meanwhile, a strangely proportioned robed aarakocra@AST flew away back to Wind’s Crossing. As it@AST landed behind a building, its@AST robes disappeared and it became just a regular aarakocra@AST. This lanky aarakocra@AST walked up to Revali’s house.

Two aarakocra guards stopped the lanky aarakocra@AST from entering. “What are you doing here?” They spoke in Aarakocran.

The lanky aarakocra@AST didn’t respond, but instead pulled out a piece of paper. On the paper, written in Revali’s handwriting, was a note that requested delivery of Revali’s medication to the shooting range. It was even signed by Revali.

The two guards looked at each other and shrugged. “Very well then, you@AST may enter.” The guards let him@AST in.

Once inside, the lanky aarakocra@AST got down on all fours and turned into a deer. Astalir’s antlers glowed, and the room was torn apart. Books and bags flew everywhere. “There’s gotta be something in here.” A bottle of medication flew by. “Oh, there that is.” Astalir placed the medication on the table by the door, for when he needed to leave.

Which he had to do sooner than expected. Wings flapped outside, and footsteps approached the door.

“Sir? I thought you were at the shooting range?” The guard said from outside.

“Yeah, and now I’m here. Move.” The door handle jiggled.

Astalir’s eyes darted around. He piled books in front of the door and re-locked it. He slipped out of the back exit of the house, just as the front door opened and a caw-caw echoed through the building. Astalir turned into a bird and flew off.

Astalir easily catches up to the party, although he is a bit disappointed that he wasn’t able to get the answers to his questions. What were those robed birds doing? Were they going to sacrifice him? If so, to who? Astalir didn’t get a good look at the runes on the altar. Astalir thinks about it as he follows the party’s tracks to the edge of town in Canadia, turning back into a deer to blend in with the moose roaming the streets, and avoiding an annoying noisy syrup salesman.

===

“Hey!” Gra shouted. “Where’d you go?”

“Nowhere.” Reesu swam up to the boat, throwing a blood-stained bag on board.

“What is this?”

“Nothing.” Reesu couldn’t hide her grin as she climbed up the side of the boat. “Just a snack for later.”

Gra sniffed it. “Smells like… human?”

“It may or may not have come from the butcher shop in town.”

“Didn’t that place get closed down over a week ago?”

“They were pickled, they’ll be fine.”

“Ok, I don’t want to know. Just keep that bag out of sight.”

“Ok!” Reesu made a waving motion over the bag, and it disappeared.

Gra kicked the spot where it was and immediately regretted it. “Not like that!”

“Well, be more specific next time.” Reesu made the bag visible again, and it floated into the air, following Reesu down into the depths of the boat.

“All aboard?” Captain Johnny asked Gra.

Gra did a headcount, then came back to the top deck. “Yeah, I think so.”

Captain Johnny unmoored the boat and set sail. The Howling Wolf was now heading to the lizard folk kingdom.

As the boat left the bay, a deer ran up onto the dock. “Hey, is that…”

Silber, in the crow’s nest, looked through his scope. “That’s your deer friend. I recognize the mended break on that antler.”

“Crap! We forgot Astalir! Turn the boat around!”

The Howling Wolf just entered the currents of the sea. “We’re too far out.” Captain Johnny refused.

Gra took off what little armor he had and prepared to dive. “I’m coming Astalir!”

“Wait.” Silber stopped Gra. “Don’t go in yet.”

“Why not?”

“Watch.”

Astalir’s antlers glowed as he jumped into the water. But instead of falling in, the water beneath him turned to ice and he skated across a sheet of ice all the way to the boat.

“Astalir, up here!” Gra waved his arms at him.

Astalir sprinted at the boat below Gra, making an ice ramp to slide up. He jumped at the top, and Gra reached down and caught him.

“You made it!” Gra stroked his head as he pulled him up onto the boat.

“Bleat!” Astalir happily leaned into Gra’s pets. “I wasn’t sure if I’d make it on time.”

“You cut it pretty close.”

“Boat ahead!” Silber called out from the crow’s nest.

“I see them.” Bob confirmed, standing on the deck. “Out there on the horizon.”

“Do they look friendly?” Captain Johnny grabbed the wheel.

“There appears to be commotion on the deck. Perhaps a mutiny.” Silber stated.

“Maybe we should go help them out.” Gra suggested.

“They are between us and the lizard kingdom.” Johnny turned the wheel straight towards the boat. “Let’s check it out.”

As they got closer, the fighting shifted to below deck, and Silber couldn’t watch it anymore. All they could do was hope they got there in time to help the survivors. When they got there, the top deck was littered with bodies.

Captain Johnny and Reesu brought the boats close enough to cross.

“Gale, come with me. Let’s see if anyone’s still alive.” Gra picked up Gale and hopped aboard. “Hello? Any here alive?”

Gale went around checking for signs of life. “This one thinks all dead.”

Gra ran to the stairs to the lower deck. “Hello? Any one down there?”

“Arrrgh!” A sailor ran up the steps, sword aimed at Gra.

Gra backed up, but tripped on the last and fell over backward onto the deck.

The yelling sailor drove his sword into Gra, stabbing him in the chest.

“Ok, that’s enough out of you.” Reesu made a fist and the yelling sailor floated into the air and dunked headfirst into the water below. “Astalir, would you do me the favor of cooling this guy down? Looks like he’s got some sort of brain swelling. Some ice should do.”

Astalir’s antlers glowed and the water around the yelling pirate’s head froze in place. The sailor stopped yelling.

But more yelling happened. Six more sailors came up the stairs, yelling with their swords drawn. They all seemed to have strange bumps on their heads, like a bruise blown up into a balloon and attached to their skull.

“Get back!” Silber yelled. He chucked a grenade into the stairwell, killing all the sailors instantly.

“This one heals you.” Gale laid a clawed hand on Gra, fingers glowing. Gra’s wound sealed up. “And a little extra, prevent infection.” Gale cured Gra of any disease he may have gotten from the blade.

“Everyone alright?” Gra stood up.

“This one ok.”

“Reesu, can you move these corpses? We have to get down there.”

“Sure.” Reesu goes to the stairwell, dropping the overboard sailor into the water. The ice ball around his head holds him upright as he drifts away from the boat.

As Reesu moved down the stairwell, dead sailor bodies flew out and into the water, attracting a school of sharks.

“Anyone down there?”

“Yeah, people in cages.”

Reesu went deeper into the boat to find more things. Gra went down, found a key and let the people out of the cage. Astalir tore the captain’s study apart, looking for documents. He found a map to a place called “Terry Town.”

“What happened here?” Gra asked.

One of the crew members turned to Gra. “Half our crew complained of real bad headaches. Then before we knew it, they grew these strange bumps on their heads, and went wild attacking us. We managed to survive by locking ourselves in this cage. They couldn’t cut through the bars, and they were too berserk to think to grab the key. Thanks for getting us out.”

“No problem. Happy to help. Stay safe on your travels.”

“God speed to you as well.” The sailor saluted.

Astalir pondered this. It wasn’t normal for people to just sprout bumps and go crazy. Something had happened to them, but what, he had no clue.

===

Meanwhile, in Sui’s adventures:

When Sui woke up, he found the note Reesu left him. He felt betrayed and abandoned for no reason. He and Leona set out to go back to Canadia.

When they got to Canadia, where they took care of a rat infestation in the syrup salesman’s basement. Sui got bitten by a rat, which seemed to suck blood out of him. Leona got the rat off him, and they killed the rest of the rats.

The syrup salesman told them that their party set sail on a boat earlier that day, and were long gone. Sui and Leona spent the night in Canadia.

# ( 18 ) S2E3: To Drown a Half-Orc

Gra, Reesu, and Astalir hopped back onto their ship. Reesu carried a bag full of random stuff and Astalir had several pieces of paper sticking out of his fur. Reesu turned around and shoved the merchant ship away.

Reesu waved at the boat as they sailed off, “So long suckers!”

Gra put a hand above his eyes. “Wait, ‘suckers’? What do you mean?”

“I got all their valuables. Wanna see?”

“But Reesu, they’re not pirates, or suckers! They’re merchants. You stole from merchants!”

Reesu reached into a bag. “Yeah, and do you want to know what I stole?”

Gra groaned. “Do I want to know?”

“Sure you do.” Reesu pulled out a long slender cylinder with a hole at one end. It had a white substance encrusted on it. “I don’t think they were *merchants*, wink wink.”

Gra turned away and gagged. “Get that away from me.”

The cylinder floated in front of Gra’s face. “C’mon, you know you want it. You know you *need* it.”

“Reesu,” Gra inched away on the railing, watching the other ship float away. “You need to respect my boundaries.”

“And you need to respect your neeeeds…”

“One of these days, I’m going to throw a punch at you, and you’re not going to know when.”

“Give it your best shot,” Reesu snarked. “For now, I’ll just stick this in here for when you need it.” Reesu opened Gra’s bag of holding and the cylinder floated down into it with a playful jerk.

Meanwhile, Astalir was below deck going through all the rooms. He entered a room and the furniture started shifting, the drawers opened, and knick-knacks flew around the room. After a few seconds, it all dropped lifelessly on the floor and Astalir left.

He went into Daisy’s room, who hid under her covers to shield herself from the commotion. “Who are you and what are you doing in my room?”

Astalir looked at her with a blank stare as the room continued to thrash about. Then he left, leaving everything to fall down.

Astalir walked into Shank’s room, who was still fast asleep from all his alcohol consumption the previous night. The chair cushion flew to the ceiling, the desk drawer spilled onto the floor, and a set of jacks flew around the room.

Shank’s eyes peaked open. He spied fresh meat, just delivering itself to him. His stomach rumbled. He grabbed his shortsword under his blanket and prepared to lift the covers up.

“Foooood!” He swung his sword with enough force to launch himself out of bed and into the deer.

Astalir reacted by headbutting the sword, catching it in his antlers.

Shank jiggled the sword back and forth, but it wouldn’t come free. Wasting no time, he unsheathed his cutlass and slashed under, hitting Astalir in the neck and drawing blood.

Astalir grunted, twisted his neck, and flung Shank’s sword out of his hands. The sword twirled into the wall, making a shiny platform big enough for a mouse. Astalir snorted out his nostrils.

Shank stood there, staring at the deer, glancing at his sword. He tried to swing his cutlass or any of his other weapons, but Astalir blocked them with his antlers. Shank hesitated to strike, lest he lose another weapon.

Suddenly a big, tall green half-orc barged through the open doorway and punched the small green goblin in the face. “That’s *my* deer you’re hurting! You don’t hurt my deer!”

Shank growls at Gra.

“What’s going on?” Reesu pushes in past Gra. “Oh my little Shank, what’re they doing to you. Come here, Shank.” Reesu pats her knees at Shank.

“Shank no understand. Who green giant? Why deer in room? Why deer no food? Where Shank?”

“We’re on a boat. That green guy is Gra, he’s my *friend*. This deer is Astalir, you know him, remember?”

“Shank no remember deer.”

Reesu’s eyes went wide, and then shifted left and right. “Oh, that’s riiiight… Shank, this is Drathalion.”

“But Drathalion cat. No deer.”

“*Drathalion*…” Reesu nudged Astalir.

Astalir jumped onto two legs and, with antlers aglow, morphed into the image of the cat, Drathalion. “Hello, I’m Astalir. Or as you know me, Drathalion.”

“Cat… deer?”

“Yes, Shank. The cat is the deer.”

Drathalion dropped onto all fours and morphed back into Astalir. “It’s me, Shank.”

“But Shank want eat deer.”

“No Shank, we can’t him.” Reesu smiled evilly. “Because we’re saving him for later.”

“What?!” Astalir’s jaw dropped.

Reesu’s cheek compressed suddenly like it got hit by a ball. “Ow.”

Astalir scowled.

“We can’t eat him because he’s sapient. Just barely.”

Astalir rolled his eyes. “And I talk.”

Shank nodded slowly. “Ah…. so deer talk mean we no eat deer.”

“Yes.”

Gra lowered his fists slowly. “So, you’re not going to hurt my deer again?”

“Shank no harm deer. Deer… friend.”

“Ok.” Gra rubbed his forehead. “Reesu, why do you always gotta grab the weird ones?”

“I grabbed you, didn’t I?”

Gra groaned.

“Actually, Shank is quite powerful. Watch this.” Astalir’s antlers lit up as a tiny version of Shank, Bob, and Drathalion appeared on the desk. The tiny Shank fell out of the sky and fell Bob with a quick flurry of slices. Tiny Drathalion shot tiny Shank in the back, but that didn’t stop him. Tiny Shank leapt onto her, slicing her up good. Tiny Drathalion threw up a rock wall between them and limped away. But tiny Shank was too fast, easily getting around the wall and stabbing her unconscious. Then, the tiny version disappeared. “He’s a super skilled fighter. He could come in handy.” Then Astalir looked at Gra’s face.

It was pure rage. His neck veins were bulging, and his fist and arm muscles were throbbing. He pulled his fist back for a punch. “You little shi—”

Astalir nuzzled his side. “I’m ok. I’m ok. It’s ok, Gra. I’m ok.”

Gra breathed heavily in and out. “But he hurt you. He *hurt* you.”

“It was a controlled encounter, a test of skill. Don was there to heal us right back up. It’s ok, he’s with us.”

Gra glanced at Astalir, and all he saw was the slash on Astalir’s neck. “Then what’s this!” He turned back to Shank. “You’ll pay for that!” Gra plunged his fist straight into Shank’s face but stopped just short of an inch from him.

Reesu held out a hand, pulling on invisible reigns. “Gra, it was a misunderstanding. Let it go.”

“Reesu, let me go.”

“Gra, you need to calm down.”

“Let me go!”

“Ok, Gra, you know what you need? You need to cool off.”

The sound of raindrops hitting the top deck echoed down to their chambers.

“Ah! How about a swimming lesson?”

“I swear to god, Reesu, if you try to get me to do a swimming lesson again, I’ll—”

“Come on, it’s been so long since you had one.”

“But I already know how to swiiiiii…”

Reesu effortlessly yanked Gra through the air into the hallway and up the stairs to the top deck.

Astalir and Shank exchanged worried glances before bolting out of the room to follow the little girl and half-orc.

“C’mon Gra!”

“No! It’s fucking raining! I don’t want to swim today!”

“You wouldn’t want to swim *any* day. And besides, today’s a great day for a swim!”

“I’d rather swim in a pond!”

Reesu carried Gra with invisible limbs as he flailed helplessly about, grabbing fruitlessly onto any piece of wood he could reach.

“It’s important to me that you know how to swim.”

“Why now! You know I can swim!”

“No I don’t.”

“I saved Astalir, remember? I swam out to save him.”

“You merely got carried by the current into him.”

“Then how did I carry him back to shore?”

“Brute strength.”

“That’s swimming!”

“Nuh-uh.” Reesu hung Gra over the edge of the boat.

“What Reesu doing? Don’t throw Gra overboard!” Gale exclaimed, using his tunic to keep his head dry.

“It’s ok, Gale, I’m just teaching Gra how to swim.”

“In the rain? Reesu mad?”

Reesu pushed Gale away. “Remember, Gra, dive feet first!” Reesu let go.

“Fuck yoooouuuu….” Gra gave her the finger as he fell off the side of the ship. He grabbed onto the side of the ship, catching his hand on a splinter, slicing it open. He grabbed the splinter, but the splinter broke off and he plunged into the water.

“Gra! Look down!” Astalir yelled from the deck.

Below Gra, the water calmed and frosted over. A floating disk of ice formed just under Gra’s feet. He landed with a thud and a crack, but he took no damage and the ice disk held. He slid on his stomach toward the edge, but a spike appeared on the surface, allowing him to get a grip.

“How you doin’ down there, Gra?” Reesu called out.

“Just fine, no thanks to you.”

“Oh, an ice sheet? That’s cheating.” Reesu dove into the water, splashing cold water all over Gra, who was already drenched from the rain. “That’s no way to learn how to swim. Unless you’re cool now?”

“You’re not going to stop me, Reesu. He’ll get what he deserves.”

“Ok, it’s time for your first lesson then!” Reesu smiled. “The doggy paddle!”

Frost in the shape of tentacles melted around the edge of the ice sheet. The ice sheet slowly sunk into the ocean.

Gra grabbed onto the spike in the middle of the disk, delaying the inevitable. “Reesuuu!”

“Catch!” A rope dropped down and hit Gra in the face. He looked up, and there were Astalir and Shank looking down at him.

“Don’t you dare touch a single hair on his furry hide!” Gra shouted up.

“Nah-uh-uh!” Reesu pulled the rope away from Gra. She continued forcing the disk down.

As the disk sank, Gra’s hand submerged into the water, spilling and diffusing blood into it.

The local wildlife took notice, and eagerly sought their prey. Five shark fins appeared above the surface of the water, swimming steadily towards Gra.

“Reesu! Sharks!” Gra pointed, hand shaking.

“Don’t worry, you’re in no danger.”

“But I can’t use my great axe in the water!”

“Don’t worry about it.”

The sharks got closer.

“Reesu!”

“Fiiine…” Reesu pointed up at the thunderstorm raining on their “swimming lesson”, sending a spark up into the dark clouds. Then a bolt of lightning struck a shark, frying it instantly. The electricity spread out in an area, frying two other sharks too. The three fried sharks floated belly-up to the surface of the water.

Gra’s arm hairs stood on end, slightly singed. “Reesu, that was stupid! You’re also in the water! I’m in the water! *We’re* in the water!”

Reesu shrugged. “We’re still here, aren’t we? Besides, a little shock won’t kill you.”

“Reesu, that kills people!”

“Well, not *you* specifically.”

“Reesu!”

“Fine, I’ll deal with them another way.” The tentacle-shaped marks on the floating ice disk filled with water and the ice started rising again. One of the sharks coming at Gra floated up into the air and flopped for dear life.

The last shark came straight for Gra, mouth wide open, bearing rows and rows of sharp teeth.

Gra reached into his bag of holding for a javelin and jammed it into the shark’s mouth. He hoisted it up into the air and held it there like a hotdog on a campfire stick.

Shank took the opportunity to unlatch his boomerang from his belt and toss it down. It landed on the skewered shark, summoning a bolt of lightning from the storm. In a flash of light, the shark died, giving off wisps of smoke that was quickly squelched by the pouring rain.

“Ok, are you cooled off now?”

“Whatever.”

“Eh, good enough.” Reesu tossed Gra the rope.

Gra climbed up the rope. “Astalir, are you ok?”

The rain tip-tapped around Astalir, unnaturally curving around him as if he had an invisible umbrella. Astalir nodded.

“Gra ok?” Gale embraced him. “This one worried.”

“Yeah. Are you ok, Gale?”

Gale shivered. “This one only cold.”

“Let’s get you inside.”

“But Gra! You have to help us get the sharks!”

“This one like sushi. This one wants shark.”

“Fuck you, Reesu. Get the sharks yourself.” Gra stomped down the stairs into the chambers, Gale in hand.

Reesu shrugged it off. She pulled up the grappled shark, still squirming. She frowned. She ripped the shark open, spilling tis guts all over the deck. She smiled mischievously. “Gra! Come look! I spilled spark guts all over the deck! Don’t you want to see?” She held a hand to her ear.

There was no response.

Reesu’s smile turned upside down, she looked down at the ground, and rubbed her shoulder. She looked up at the commotion on the deck.

“These sharks are too heavy! I can’t lift them from here.” Astalir strained.

“Shark too far to tie rope.” Shank peered over the railing. “Deer!”

“Yes?”

“What if Shank throw rope, deer tie rope?”

“…deer tie rope…” Astalir repeated. “Ah, I get it!”

“Deer get it!” Shank threw the rope into the water near the sharks.

Astalir concentrated on the rope, which tied itself around the shark’s tail. “There, tied!”

“Deer help Shank pull.” Shank pulled on the rope, dragging the shark up and out of the water.

Astalir shrugged. “I’ll try.” The rope tugged itself towards Shank, making it slightly easier for him to pull up the shark.

The shark inched up the side of the boat, but got stuck right below the edge of the deck. The goblin and the deer struggled, but the shark didn’t come up.

Reesu’s smile returned. “Well, look at you two playing so nicely. Let me get that.” Reesu picked up the shark and flopped it onto the deck.

“Reesu strong!” Shank commented.

“Nice work, guys.” Reesu said. “Now to get the other three.”

They got the rest of the sharks. Astalir sliced open their middles, examining their stomach contents. Shank bit indiscriminately into all the sharks, tasting around for the juiciest meat.

“Why sharks all taste charcoal?” He complained.

Reesu went below deck. She pushed on Gra’s door, but it didn’t move. She knocked. “Gra, can I come in?”

“Go away, Reesu.”

“Ok.” Reesu walked away, then turned back around on all fours. In Astalir’s voice, she knocked again, “Gra, can I come in?”

“Let yourself in.”

Reesu gets out her lockpicking tools, only to discover that the door doesn’t have a lock. She peeks in through a crack, and finds the locking mechanism: a wooden board that slides down into two metal holders on either side of the door. Reesu squints, and casts mage hand in the room. A glowing pink hand appears in the middle of the room at waist height.

But before she can do anything with it, Gra slaps it down. “Go away. This is a bro moment.”

“But Gra.”

“What do you want, Reesu?”

“I don’t know…” Reesu touches her index fingers together, swaying to one side. Her downward-pointing face was turning red. “I just want to… hang out with you.”

“Not right now Reesu. I need some space.”

“Let me in or I break down the door.”

Gra groaned. “Don’t go breaking things. It’s not our ship.”

“You’re not my dad! My dad’s dead!”

“I thought you lived for 10,000 years?”

“That doesn’t stop us from being stabbed.” Reesu giggled and then quickly stifled it. “Graaa… I have 5 ways of getting in. Some break the ship, some dooon’t…”

“I’m not letting you in, Reesu.”

“Ok, but just remember, this was *your* decision.”

“Whatever.”

Reesu stomped away up to the deck of the ship. Astalir and Shank were still going through the sharks. She marched right up to the edge of the water, and with a spur of passion in her eye, she raised both her arms ritualistically into the air. “Serpent of the sea, do my bidding!”

“Reesuuu…” Astalir turned. “What are you doing?”

“Stay out of it, Astalir.”

A huge tidal wave appeared out in the middle of the ocean. Reesu beckoned it closer. The tidal wave nodded as if agreeing to obey. Reesu waved it forwards as she turned her back to it and walked down to the chambers.

The wave followed close behind, flowing down the stairwell like a waterfall and flooding the lower decks. Reesu lifted her hand, and the water followed suit. It floated through the air into Gra’s room via the cracks in the wooden walls.

“Oh, shit! What’s this?” Gra’s voice came through the walls.

“Graaa…”

“Oh, it’s just Reesu.” Gra sighed. “Reesu…” Gra’s footsteps approached the door, and the wooden barricade scraped on the metal holders.

“I told you I’d get in.” Reesu smirked as the door creaked open.

“Sorry, Gale.” The yinglet was shoved into Reesu’s face, and before Reesu could react, the door was shut and barricaded again.

Reesu shoved Gale aside and pounded on the door. “Let me in!”

“No!”

“Fiiine…” Reesu snickered. “But you can’t stay in there forever!” Reesu directed the flowing water with more pressure and volume into Gra’s room. Reesu peeked in through another crack. The water rose rapidly above Gra’s toes, ankles, and up his shin.

Up on top of the deck, Astalir’s eyes went wide when he witnessed the wave crashing down onto the deck. He bared his glowing antlers, directing as much water as he could around himself, but he still got wet. The wave washed over him and that was it. He was still standing.

But then he turned around, to find a stream running up the side of the boat, across the deck, and into the lower decks. He grabbed a hold of the stream like a string and tugged on it, but the stream wouldn’t be redirected. He thrust his antlers into the air, and with a bright glow, he froze the entire stream in place. But more water came pouring in, breaking the ice into pieces as it paraded down its path unerringly.

Focusing on bending the flow around him, he jumped down the stairs and into the chamber hallway. There, he found Reesu staring a single eye into a crack in the wall. The water split off into several smaller streams that all filed into the walls of a single room.

“What’s going on down here?”

“None of your business, Astalir.”

“Is that Gra’s room? Is Gra in there?”

“Go away, Astalir. This doesn’t concern you.”

Astalir searched all the rooms, but didn’t find Gra. He did however, find a wet Gale in Daisy’s room. “Where’s Gra?”

“Gra’s room is flooding with water, so Gra kick this one out.”

Astalir’s eyebrows furrowed with determination. He approached the door to Gra’s room. “Gra, are you in there?”

No response.

“Gra? Gra!”

No response.

“I’ve been trying to get in for a while now, and haven’t gotten in. There’s no way you’re going to get in.”

Astalir ignored her. He pushed the door in, but it didn’t budge. He tried peeking into the room to cast mage hand from inside, but when he did, he got a squirt of water in the eye. “Ok, Gra, stand back!” Astalir leaned up against the opposite wall in this narrow hallway and charged at the door. The door didn’t budge.

Astalir’s eyes darted around. He tried freezing the holes that the water was flowing in through, but again the extreme pressure of the water broke the ice instantly. Finally, he turned his attention to Reesu.

“Reesu, stop it!”

“He’ll be fine. Water is fine. I’m only drowning him.”

“Reesu! That kills people!”

Reesu waved it off. “Nah, Gra will be fine.”

Astalir walked away, and came back with Gale sitting in his antlers. “Reesu, you leave me no choice.”

“Astalir, I’m warning you.”

Astalir jostled his head forward, flinging Gale onto Reesu’s shoulders.

“Reesu no hurt Gra!”

“Calm down, Gale, I’m not going to hurt him.”

“But that one said you hurt Gra.”

“Astalir has little confidence in his abilities.”

“No, it’s more that I have more confidence in *your* abilities.”

“Why thank you, Astalir.”

“Wait, that came out wrong.” Astalir shook his head. “But the point is, you’re a threat. Gale, now!”

“Wait! This one no want hurt friend!”

Astalir didn’t hesitate. He teleported forward, and an arrow flew out from him, slicing the webbing between Reesu’s thumb and index finger.

Reesu stumbled backward in surprise, but managed to refocus on her water spell. She shook her head at the deer. “Oh, Astalir. Tsk, tsk.”

“Gale, now!”

“Please stop.” Gale screeched.

“Gale, I thought you were with me?”

“This one no want friends fight, this one no want ship to flood.”

“That’s right, *Astalir*.” Reesu walked up to him, and booped him on the nose. Her finger went right through his face. She pretended to smear the blood from her hand all over his face. Then she stepped right through him to get to the real Astalir. “If you knock me out, which I assume *was* your goal, then I’ll lose concentration, and the whole ship will be flooded. Do you want that?”

“I won’t let you hurt my friend.” Astalir snorted.

“Well then I’ll just have to make *you* lose concentration, then.” Reesu cornered Astalir and grappled him with her invisible tentacles. The fake Astalir immediately disappeared. She hoisted Astalir up onto Gale’s shoulders, making a 3-stack.

“Shank? Help!” Astalir squeaked out before being muffled.

“What do?” Shank swayed left and right, then darted into a room. He came back with a bent coat hanger. He slipped in through the doorframe and tried lifting the barricade, but the coat hanger bent instead.

Reesu patted him on the head as she pushed him out of the way. “Good idea, Shanky.” She froze some of the water flowing up into the room into solid thin bars. They lifted up under the barricade, unlocking it.

Astalir struggled to break free.

The door pushed itself open, bending the water around it so none spilled out. Reesu crouched, looked at the door and Astalir, and then made a break for the doorway. She tossed Astalir and Gale into the hallway, and before Astalir could catch her, she had gone into the room and locked the door behind her.

Inside, the room was flooded up the ceiling. Reesu took it all in, breathing in the fresh water. She exhaled, expelling the last air bubbles left in her lungs. She scanned the room. The lantern on the desk was still lit, as the water had flowed around it, and its light meandered in melancholy patterns across the room.

In the corner of the room, next to the bed, sat Gra in a damp study chair with his arms and legs crossed, and a bucket on his head.

“I let myself in, like you said.” Reesu smiled. “I made it in.”

Gra itched his nose, then his arms returned to their crossed positions.

From outside the room, scraping sounds scratched the door. “Gra, are you ok in there?” More scraping sounds. “Reesu you better not do anything to him!”

“Fiiine…” Reesu waved the water aside, and it suddenly stopped flowing. It reversed directions, and flowed outwards.

“Gah!” Astalir exclaimed. A thud sounded from the hallway.

The water quickly flowed out of the room, going down to Gra’s ankles.

Reesu pulled moisture out of Gra’s clothes and his chair, adding them to the flow of water leaving the room.

Gra swaps his crossed legs.

Reesu sits on his lap, sliding her hand gently up under the bucket onto his cheek.

Gra picked her up and set her on the floor, then crossed his arms again.

Reesu put a finger to her mouth, contemplating at the ground. Peering under Gra’s bucket, she calmly stated. “Astalir is fine, in case you heard any of that.”

Gra tapped his foot on the ground.

“Gra? Gra!” The barricade scraped as it lifted up.

Reesu looked at it, and it shunted back down. “See? He’s fine.”

Gra coughed.

“Can you lift the helmet up for just a second? I have something important to tell you.” The bucket rises by itself into the air.

Gra grabbed the helmet and clamped it down.

“Eya!” Reesu focuses on the helmet, and it tears itself from Gra’s grasp.

Gra’s brows were down, as was his mouth. The bags under his eyes told Reesu that he was fed up with her nonsense.

“I’ll keep it brief, don’t worry.” Reesu made herself comfy on his lap. She swung her arms around his neck and drew in close. Her lips approached his, but the look in his eyes gave her pause. Instead, she planted them on his cheek. “There, that was what I wanted to tell you.”

Gra scowled.

Reesu tilted her head, giving him sad puppy dog eyes. “Ok, Gra, I’ll leave you be.” The bucket drifted back down onto his head. She hopped off his lap and watched him watch her go to the door. She unbarred it, and—

*WHAM!*

The door popped open, spilling a desperate deer onto the floor, and shoving a hopeless romantic into the wall.

“Gra! Are you ok?” Astalir looks over Gra, but doesn’t see any sign of movement. “Gale! He’s not breathing!”

The yinglet ran into the room. “Clear the way!” Gale jumps on Gra, slamming right into his stomach.

“Oh—!” Gra grabs his belly.

“He’s alive!” Astalir bellowed.

“I’m alive.” Gra grabbed Gale and rubbed his furry head. He pulled Astalir in by the neck, setting his head in his lap.

“This one thought you drown!”

“No, I had a bucket, I could’ve lasted twice as long.”

Gale cried, and tears fell from Astalir’s eyes.

“Ah, don’t cry, I made it out ok.” Gra wiped a tear from the deer’s eyes.

“Cry? No, that was, uh, shape water.” Astalir shook.

“Ok, well I know just what to do.” Gra shut the door in Reesu’s face and barricaded it.

He picked up his animals and plopped onto the bed. Astalir laid across the headboard pillows and rested his head on Gra’s chest. Gale made himself comfy in the nook between Gra’s knees. Gra laid a hand on both of them, softly stroking their fur. It wasn’t long before they were both sound asleep.

“Goodnight, my pets.”

Outside, in the hallway, Reesu has a fist raised, ready to knock on the door. She hangs her head and lowers her fist. “Ok, I hear you.” She rubs a tear out of her eye. “Shank!”

“Reesu call?”

“Wanna share a room?”

“Reesu strong, Shank strong. We protect us.”

“That’s right, Shank! We protect us!”

Reesu and Shank cuddled in bed. Reesu squeezed Shank tight while she stroked his wild unkempt hair.

“Shank want—”

“Shh, shh…”

Reesu watched as Shank sank into a slumber. He breathed so softly, especially for a battle-scarred, emotionally wounded goblin. She let him sleep.

Outside, it was raining. Reesu wandered up to the top deck, wrapped some invisible tentacles around the bow railings to keep herself attached, and let herself drift off into a magical sleep.

It had been too long since Reesu had had a dream. She couldn’t remember the last time she had. And here she was, falling into a magical sleep. She floated in the black, unblinking void.

“What do you want?” She asked the void.

A string of lights lit up one by one, illuminating a messy bouquet of tentacles. A set of glowing, menacing eyes opened at the epicenter, staring directly into Reesu’s soul. “You.”

Slimy glowing ghost tentacles sprouted out of Reesu’s chest, pulling her limbs back and her head forward, forcing her to stare back.

“Sorry, I don’t arrive on command.”

The entity gave a low chuckle. “Reesu, the eternal trickster. As lively as ever; I would expect nothing less.”

“What do you want?”

“Where’s the fun Reesu I bond all those centuries ago? Take a guess.”

“No, I’m not giving you a handjob.”

“There’s my girl. You’ll know your assignment the moment you need it. No fun unless I keep you guessing.”

“Yeah, fun. It’s been fun, but I must be waking up now.”

“Surely, you’d like to stay for a few more hours of fun? Perhaps 144 more hours?”

“No, I got a cuddle party to crash.”

“Well I can’t interrupt important business like that. But please, don’t be a stranger, eh? Stopping in again, soon, I hope?”

“Where’s the fun in telling you that?”

The entity laughed. “Godpower, Reesu. My power, specifically.” It chuckled to itself as it faded back into the void, letting Reesu linger in the void by herself.

When she did wake up, it was to the voice of Shank screaming her name. “Reesu! Shank in water! Save Shank!”

“Shank?” She looked around, but he was nowhere in the room. The noise was coming from outside. She rushed to the top deck and found Shank overboard and getting left behind. “Shank!” She dove into the water and grabbed him. One more moment more, and she was climbing the side of the ship, dragging him back onto the deck.

“Shank thank you. Shank no like water.”

“What happened?”

“Captain go. Wheel turn. Shank help. Wheel turn. Shank overboard.”

“What?”

Bob walked by, idly snacking on some zombie jerky. “Oh hey, Shank. Welcome back aboard.” We walked on by.

“Did you see what happened?”

“Yeah, the captain drew some weird red card from the deck of random oddities. He disappeared and then Shank took the wheel. I asked him if he could steer it, and he said yes. I assumed he flung himself overboard on purpose.”

“Are you alright Shank?”

“Shank good now.”

Just then, Captain Johnny reappeared at the wheel. He staggered backward and collapsed backward on to the deck.

“Welcome back aboard, Captain.”

Reesu and Shank rushed to him. “Are you ok?”

“I don’t trust that shit anymore.” His eyes were wide and unblinking. His eyes were shaking, as they stared at no point in particular, but remained fixed in place. His trembling limbs were stiff and unmoving. He passed out with his eyes wide open.

“Captain not ok.”

“You’re right, Shank, there’s something wrong with him.”

“Eh, I’ve seen worse. He’ll be fine.” Bob walked off.

Off in the distance, the mainland of the lizard folk country appeared. The party prepared to disembark, allowing Reesu a perfect excuse to postpone processing her feelings and her patron’s mysterious request. She shrugged it off. It’s time for another adventure.

===

Meanwhile, in Sui’s adventures:

Sui and Leona headed to the kobold cave.

Along the way, they had to go through the misty graveyard again. They tried walking through it, but a mysterious stranger set off the zombies, who all went into a frenzy, attacking everything in sight. Leona managed to help save the stranger, while Sui killed the zombies and the purple plant monster in the middle of the graveyard.

The stranger was a man with the face of a deer, with a matching pair of antlers. He asked them if they had seen a dark-skinned rogue, but they said no. The stranger followed them to town, where they parted ways.

Sui and Leona returned to the kobold cave, where they found the kobold chief dead, pierced by a dozen arrows. Upon seeing Sui’s new dragon wings, Sylla and the rest of the kobolds worshipped him even more than they did before. Sui made himself right at home as the new leader of the kobold cave.

# ( 19 ) S2E4: Fresh Water

The party disembarked *The Howling Wolf* onto the mainland that held within it, somewhere, the lizardfolk kingdom.

It was significantly hotter over here on the mainland. The party took off their winter clothes and stuffed them in Gra’s bag of holding. Gale seemed to really love the heat, while the others were not so happy. Reesu took extra time getting out of the ocean water, Gra removed his shirt, and Astalir tried freezing salt water.

The salt water did not freeze. So Astalir went on to search for some fresh water to keep himself cool. He was panting heavily, despite Gra letting him take a drink from his canteen. He climbed cliffs and stared off into the distance, but he didn’t find anything, not even a river. He eventually found some berries, but they only helped so much. Gra suggested that the lizardfolk kingdom might have more shade.

Astalir, on all fours, scouted ahead to see if he could find how to get there. The map to “Terry Town” that he had found on the “merchant” ship was very limited, and only showed very little of the mainland. Not very useful, unfortunately.

Off in the distance, he heard some shouting, laughing, and beer guzzling. He got close enough to get a look. It was a camp full of tents and human men sitting around campfires. Astalir retreated back to Gra.

“So, what did you find?” Gra asked.

Astalir told him what he saw. “There was some mention of Robin Hood.”

“Sounds like bandits.” Gra rubbed his chin. “We should avoid them.”

“I want to see if they know how to get to our destination.”

“Hmm.” Gra scanned the horizon. “Very well. Go out there, get some information, and come right back. Do *not* engage them in battle or enter their camp. Ok?”

“I’m not Reesu.”

“So you understand?”

“Yes, I understand.” Astalir nodded.

“Good.” Gra grabbed Astalir and petted his head. “I don’t want my little deer buddy getting hurt. Be safe out there.”

“Will do.” Astalir smiled.

Astalir took off down the path, but he didn’t get far before running into Reesu, who he nearly tripped over. “Reesu?”

“Hi Astalir, where are you going?” She leaned forward, hands behind her back, sweet eyes open.

“To do some recon.”

“Recon? That sounds like fun. Mind if I join?”

“Why do you want to do recon? You’re not the… recon type.”

“I heard you were going to meet some bandits. I’d like to eat them too.”

“I’m not eating them.”

“No, silly, I said ‘meet’ them.” She looked up at him sweetly.

Astalir side-eyed her.

“Plus, if you get into trouble, I can bail you out.”

Astalir rolled his eyes. “Fine, come along.”

“Yay!” Reesu clapped her hands and hopped on Astalir’s back. “Giddy up!”

“I didn’t say you could ride me.”

“Can I ride you?” Reesu stroked Astalir’s neck. “We’ll get there much faster that way.”

“Ah… sure.” Astalir took off down the trail, Reesu on his back.

She tried to hold onto his antlers, but she shook him off. She settled for wrapping invisible tentacles around his waist, securing herself to him like a seatbelt. It was very effective at keeping her on, despite the ups and downs of his running cycle.

Finally, they got to the bandit camp, and the cheers and shouts of the human men became apparent. “Ok, Reesu, time to get off.”

Reesu slid off and landed on the ground.

“Hey, you can shapeshift, right?”

In response, Reesu grew taller, blackened her fingernails, sprouted fur all around her body, and donned a set of antlers. “Hey, you can shapeshift, right?”

“Very nice.” Astalir stood on his hindlegs and became bipedal. His antlers glowed, and an image of Robin Hood appeared over top of him. “Can you a bandit?”

Reesu peeked around their cover at one of the bandits. “No.”

“Why not?”

“Because I don’t want to.”

“Well, Reesu, this is a diplomatic mission. We want to get in and out without confrontation—”

“I’ve got a better idea.” Reesu pulled up on her hand like she was pulling off a glove, and it disappeared. She did the same with the other hand. She touched her invisible hand to her chest, and touched moved her right nub to Robin Hood’s chest. An indent appeared on his chest before the nub touched. Slowly, Reesu began to fade away, rippling out from where she laid her hand.

Robin Hood turned back into Astalir. “Reesu what are you doing?”

“Relax, this is going to be great.”

Astalir disappeared gradually but steadily. Finally, there was nothing left of them, just empty air.

“Reesu?” Astalir looked down at his hands. He couldn’t see them.

“Relax, we’re just invisible. Do your ‘tear the room apart’ thing and we can get out without having to talk to anyone of them.”

“Ok…” *THUD*. Astalir suddenly saw the ground from up close.

“Oh, and it helps if you keep your hands out of your line of sight, to avoid the shock of not being able to see them.”

“Thanks, I think I’ll just walk.” Astalir stood on all fours.

“I think it came from over here.” One of the bandits were getting closer.

“Good luck! Bye!” Reesu’s footprints suddenly ended as an overhead branch dipped down and dropped some leaves.

Astalir stood motionless as the bandits approached. If he moved, he could make noise with his footsteps, and he would leave behind a strange set of appearing hoofprints, which would tip them off that there was something invisible walking around.

The bandits approached but didn’t find anything.

One bandit got close to Astalir and examined his hoofprints. “It looks like a deer was here.”

“Any clue where it went?”

“No, the tracks end here.” The bandit idly took a stick and tapped the hoofprint.

Astalir moved his leg out of the way so the stick wouldn’t make contact.

“Hey! I didn’t do it!” A shout came from within the camp. “Stop hitting me!”

“Sounds like a fight!” The stick bandit said. He and the other bandit ran back to the camp.

Astalir breathed a sigh of relief. He sneakily approached the camp, and noticed that there was a big crowd gathered around the largest tent.

He didn’t waste any time. He moved from tent to tent, moving things around in a dizzying storm of items. He found mostly dirty laundry, hidden coin purses, and random kernels of corn.

He didn’t even bother trying to be stealthy about it. The fact that he was invisible and there was a lot of commotion in the big central tent gave him all the cover he needed. That is, until the commotion stopped.

“Ok, break it up people.” A big, deep voice bellowed. “You two, come with me to my tent.”

Astalir peeked out of the current tent he was in to find three men walking his way. He hurried up and ransacked the rest of the room. Hidden in a corner, he found another map to Terry Town, but this one had a particular location circled. Astalir pocketed the map in his fur, and then jumped out of the tent, letting the door flap around in the wind.

The deep-voiced bandit growled when he got close. He looked inside his tent and flipped out. “Who did this?”

“Not me.” The two guys who had been fighting, both heavily bruised in the face, shrugged.

“Hey, who went through my stuff?” Another bandit called out.

“Why is my sock not under my covers where it usually is?”

“Someone dumped my corn stash!”

The bandits were all in a frenzy about their tents being ransacked.

The deep voiced bandit called out. “Fan out! Scour the camp! We’ve got a thief among us! Let’s find him!”

The bandits all drew there weapons and peeled their eyes to keep a look out for any would-be thief.

“Which one of us do you think it is? I bet it’s laundry-licking Larry.”

“Nah, he’s sneaky when he takes your stuff. Whoever did this is not one of us.”

Astalir hid behind a bush and watched the bandits roam around. They weren’t going to find him, or Reesu, at least not until the spell wears off. Speaking of which, how long did it last? Astalir couldn’t risk getting caught out, so he had to act fast to search all the tents. So far, he had only searched half of the camp.

He snuck around the camp no problem, pausing any time anyone paid any attention to the very quiet steps he was taking.

He got to the next tent on his list. He opened the flap quietly, and peeked his head inside. It was vacant, but not empty. He tore the room apart. Objects flew off all over everywhere. It made a lot of noise, but so far no bandit had come to investigate.

Among the chaos, he found a rolled up piece of paper. He stopped to unroll it, allowing the objects flying through the air to fall. One of them was a glass jar with holes in the lid. It shattered when it hit the ground, releasing a small frog.

The frog let out a loud *RIIIIBBBBIIIT*, almost too loud for such a small animal.

Astalir winced. He looked behind him, and found a bandit running toward him. He grabbed the scroll without looking at it and ran off behind the tent.

“Kremet, how did you get out of your jar? Are you ok?” The bandit entered the tent. “My room! It’s torn apart! The thief! He was here!”

Astalir stepped on a twig while going around the tent.

The frog bandit followed, trying to sneak up on the invisible deer.

Astalir froze, hoping the frog bandit would go away.

But the frog bandit kept moving closer, and would soon be touching him.

Astalir reacted by turning visible and running off into the forest.

“An invisible deer!” The frog bandit readied his crossbow and ran after him.

Astalir, smugly, was actually in the same spot. He was still invisible, and had instead sent a silent image of himself out into the woods.

The silent image clone of Astalir ran through the woods, leading the frog bandit and a few other bandits away. Eventually the illusory deer jumped over a log and disappeared. The bandits all looked around confused, trying to find the “invisible deer” that was no longer even there.

Astalir took the opportunity to sneak around the rest of the camp. He found a pool of water, and he salivated. Finally, a place to cool off to escape the heat! He looked around briefly for bandits, but didn’t care enough. He dived into the pound, and took a sip. It was fresh water! He drank it up.

A bandit spotted him and pointed. “Look! Something invisible is in the water!”

Astalir looked down. Although his leg was indeed invisible, it very visibly displaced the water around it. “Shoot.”

The bandit did just that. He lifted his crossbow, aimed at the center of the displacement in the water, and pulled the trigger.

Astalir splashed in the pool and froze the wave. It caught the tail end of the bolt, stopping it in its tracks, just inches from his chest.

Suddenly the crossbow bandit flew backwards into the tree line, floated up into the air, and split in two. Behind him, a little red-haired girl with an evil grin faded into view.

Astalir recoiled. He jumped out of the water, freezing some specks of snow onto his fur as he did so. He lifted a pool of water to float behind him. He approached the little girl.

“Ok, Reesu let’s go.”

“No.”

“C’mon, we got what we came here for. Let’s get out of here.”

“Maybe you got what you came here for…” She jumped out of the trees and kidnapped another bandit, killing it instantly. “But I haven’t.”

“Reesu, your invisibility spell wore off. They can see you now.”

“So?” Reesu knabbed another bandit, who was searching for the bandit that had just been killed. “They can see you too now, you know.”

Astalir looked at his leg. The snowflakes stuck to it outlined his otherwise invisible limb. “Oh.”

“That was pretty stupid of you to jump in the pond. Good thing I was—” Reesu took a bite out of a bandit. “—there to save you.”

“Yeah, yeah, you’re right. Now let’s go.”

“No!” Reesu took down another solitary bandit. She roamed around the camp, killing bandits one by one.

“You’re sick, Reesu. Bye.” Astalir ran off into the woods, holding his pool of freshwater behind him. Astalir ran back to Gra, leaving Reesu by herself in the bandit camp.

=======

“What these ones will do now?” Gale asked.

“We wait for Astalir to come back from his scouting mission.” Gra held Gale in his lap.

A knocking noise came from the woods.

“Stranger, 3:00.” Silber said. He was standing on the cliffside.

“Why is robot talking in time?” Gale asked.

“He’s telling us the direction of that sound, whatever it is.” Gra answered.

“Shank go find out.” Shank ran off towards the sound.

“Well we better make sure he doesn’t get in trouble.” Gra put Gale on his shoulder and followed.

In the woods, they found a grey-scaled dragonborn wearing a white pair of shorts held up by a blue belt. He was punching a tree.

“Hut-hut-hut! Hut-hut-hut!” His rhythm was very consistent and infectious.

Shank pulled out his short sword and swung it to the rhythm.

The dragonborn seemed to not notice them. “Hut-hut-hut! Hut-hut-hut!” He continued punching the tree. “Hut-hut-HUT!” With a surprisingly agile kick, he knocked Shank’s sword right out of his hand. “What are you doing here?”

“Shank here you punch tree. Shank want to fight, prove skill.”

“Ah, you want to challenge *me* to a duel?”

“Shank duel tree puncher.”

“The name’s Kluurthal. And alright, I’ll duel you. First to get their opponent to half health wins.”

“Shank fight.”

Kluurthal got in a flurry of blows in quick succession, but Shank stabbed him through the arm and straight into his chest, pinning his arm down. Then Shank stabbed him with his other swords, and Kluurthal was stuck to the very tree he was punching.

“Very well,” Kluurthal spit out some blood. “You have bested me in combat. Next time… next time I won’t go easy on you.”

“You strong warrior, but…” Shank pondered. “Not stronger than Shank.”

“What happened here!” Gra shouted as he caught up. “Shank what did you do?”

“Shank fight tree puncher. Shank win.”

“He got me alright. Say, can you help me out?”

“Gale.” Gra set Gale down and removed Shank’s swords from the dragonborn.

Gale wasted no time in healing his wounds. Glowing paws pressed into his chest, sealing the punctures closed.

“These your friends?”

“Shank friends with robot. Robot friends with orc and rat.”

“Yeah, the goblin’s with us.” Gra confirmed. “Sorry he hurt you so bad.”

“No, it was a duel. He got me fair and square.”

Off in the distance, sounds of approaching hooves could be heard. Gra turned his attention to it, but didn’t see Astalir. Instead, a constellation of melting snowflakes twinkled closer as a ball of floating water chased it. As it got closer, the snowflakes more obviously formed a deer shape.

“Astalir?”

“It’s me.”

“What happened to you? Are you some kind of spirit creature now? Is this your true form?”

“No, I’m just invisible. And I don’t know how to end the spell.”

“What’s with all this?” Gra touched a snowflake.

“I have to keep cool somehow.”

“Ah, good idea. I take it you found some drinking water?”

Astalir motioned behind him. “Yep.”

The party follows Kluurthal to the nearest town, which Astalir noted to be Terry Town. He pulled out the map he stole from the deep-voiced bandit’s tent. The circled place seemed to be a bakery. He found the shop and walked in.

Inside was an old woman behind the counter. Astalir asked her a specific question in thieves’ cant, and she responded by giving him a blueberry bun. He paid her with a rock disguised as a coin.

He took the bun and ate it while wandering around the streets. He bumped into an official-looking human who introduced himself as Terry. Terry wanted to know what business he had in this town, so Astalir took out a piece of paper and Terry read it. The message was written in a language that Terry didn’t know, so Terry just let him go.

Astalir found a nice, shady spot to relax and get out of the heat.

=======

*Author’s note: I fell asleep at the tail end of this session, and had a dream. This section is based on that dream.*

As Astalir laid in the shade, he gazed at the back alley he was in. It was overgrown with plants and shrubbery, with only a thin walking path to move around in. The part he was laying in was occupied by thick grass that heavily obscured him from view of passersby. As the sun shone down from overhead, Astalir drifted off to sleep.

“Hey buddy, come here.” Gra waved to Astalir. “I got something for you.”

Astalir waved his nose around in the air, picking up the scent of the treat.

“It’s berry juice, your favorite!” Gra uncapped his canteen and held it up to Astalir’s nose.

It smelled like blueberries fresh of the vine on a summer’s day, mixed in with the fresh scent of spring dirt.

Astalir licked his lips. His antlers glowed, and the berry juice snaked out of the canteen and marched into his mouth. Astalir gulped it all down. It tasted like sweet grapes mixed with strawberries.

Then Astalir woke up. The alleyway was empty, save for a passing cat. Astalir got up and moved to another corner, to be out of the sunlight again. He drifted back to sleep.

# ( 21 ) S2E6: Grand Theft Gra

It was cold and brisk when Astalir woke up. The sun was threatening to overtake the night, but the bitter chill of the morning wind pushed it back. A shiver crept up Astalir’s neck, piercing his fur. Something was wrong.

That demon of a mayor who kept harassing him was nowhere to be seen, but neither was anyone else. The streets were entirely empty, in an eerie way, even for this time of day.

Astalir got up from his grass spot and looked around. He found Gale sleeping in a similar grass spot, but no one else. He peeked through windows, but none showed any signs of life.

It’s probably just a bit too early, right?

Astalir entered the tavern. The fireplace was filled with ash, not even warm to the touch. The tables and chairs lay in haphazard arrangements in the dining hall, but had no occupants. Not even the bar stools boasted business. The concierge desk was likewise vacant.

Astalir ventured down the hall to where Gra and Reesu were probably sleeping. He tested the rooms one by one, picking the locks with a floating pick and a flickering antler tine. All the rooms were empty.

At the end of the hallway, he came across an unlocked door. It was left slightly ajar, as if someone was in a hurry and forgot to shut it. Inside, Astalir found a note on the bed stand.

*Hello AstaliR.*

*EvEryday I got to spEnd with you was the new best day of my life.  
Loved the times we got to Spend oUtside the Kobold cave, watching your Illusions, feeDing you berries, laughiNg, getting to know you.  
Please know that the decision I make now is not At all Personal, and that it Pains me that I Even have to Do this.*

*Maybe in the future, we will meet again, and if we do, don’t be afraid to say hi to ME!*

*Eternally yours, Gra*

Astalir read this and gasped. Finding his own kin would have to wait. His one and only true friend was in danger! He had to find Gra right away and save him from what was probably a life-threatening situation.

Astalir’s antlers lit up in a glorious display, as if he had Christmas lights on them. The room lit up like a disco at Christmas time. He scoured the room for clues.

There was a drop of saliva at the door threshold, a pair of underwear under the bed, a wrinkled bed sheet, a fresh ink stain on the end table, and an eyelash encased in gum arabic on the floor. Not to mention four curious parallel scrapes on the outside of the door.

Astalir put it all together, sending a flicker of light up his antler that became an illusion of Gra and Reesu.

=======

Reesu opened the door, holding Gra by the hand. She ran a finger down his chest, drooling. “I can’t wait to show you a ‘secret’ I’ve been hiding.” A drop of drool hit the floor.

“Reesu, what’s this all about?” Gra shut the door and sat on the bed.

“Well, Gra, it’s that time of century, and I’ve chosen you.” Reesu wiggled her legs provocatively and a piece of cloth shimmied down her legs from under her dress. The underwear fell to the floor. She sat on his lap. “Now that I’ve shown you *my* secret, it’s time for you to show me *yours*.”

“Reesu, I don’t think this is a good idea.” Gra pushed her away, but she stayed firm on his lap.

“Why not?” Reesu pouted.

“Well, I—I just don’t like you like that…”

Reesu gave him an angry glare.

“I just don’t like that you… and I… are here.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, you know, the party is probably in the other rooms, and they can probably hear everything we’re saying. I don’t want them to know… what we’re up to, you know?”

Reesu nodded. “Hmmm, hmm. I see.”

“So how about we wait until after this mission is over, then we can talk about it then.” Gra set Reesu on the ground.

“Or!” Reesu lit up. “We can run away, to someplace where the party can’t find us, and then do it!”

“Well, no, we can’t do that…”

“Why not?”

“Because… in my culture, you can’t fornicate… until your parents approve your mate.”

“Well, your parents ABANDONED you!”

“Well… them’s the rules. And you know me, I always follow the rules.”

Reesu squinted at him.

Gra gave her an uneasy smile.

“Fine.” Reesu put her hands on her hips. “We’ll go to your family to approve this first, and then do it.”

“But we have a mission to do!”

“Yes, and that mission is to get you to your folks!” Reesu picked up Gra with telekinesis or something, the thing that she does.

“Wait wait wait!” Gra flung his arms around.

“What now?”

“What about Astalir?”

“What *about* Astalir?” Reesu returned.

“We can’t leave without telling him where we’re going!”

“We can’t tell him where we’re going!”

“Why not?”

“Because he’ll follow us and then I’ll be forced to do *bad* things to him.” Reesu, despite being an illusion, looked directly at where Astalir was standing.

Astalir jolted back.

“Well at least let me say goodbye.”

“Ok.” Reesu dropped Gra on the bed, wrinkling the sheets. She squatted on the end table, and a drop of ink fell onto it. The fresh ink stain reflected the light around it. Reesu pulled a quill and paper out of Gra’s bag of holding. “Here, you want to say goodbye? Say goodbye.”

Gra looked into Reesu’s eyes. “Thank you.” He knelt on the ground in front of the end table and wrote out the note, then packed the quill back in his bag. “Oh wait! Shouldn’t we also write a note to Silber, to discharge him from his duties?”

“Ok now you’re just stalling.” Reesu plucked out one of her eyelashes and stuck it into something sticky. She chanted some ancient words while holding Gra in the air. They both vanished. The eyelash in the gum arabic fell to the floor. Then the claw marks on the door appeared and the door shut, but only enough to be ajar.

=======

Astalir’s heart raced. How fast was Reesu? Could he catch her? It didn’t matter if he couldn’t see them. But Reesu is sloppy and Gra is clever. Surely there’s some way he can catch them.

Astalir ran outside to where he saw Gale. “Gale! Gale!” He shook him awake.

“What is happening? Is earth quake?” The yinglet rubbed his eyes. “Deer friend, what you do? Why wake up yinglet so early?”

“Gra’s been kidnapped! We have to save him!”

“Oh no! Who kidnap Gra?!”

Astalir looked away. “I don’t know yet. You in?”

“Gale help deer. Let us go!”

Astalir scooped Gale up into his antlers and took off.

The trail was easy to follow. Reesu left footprints in the mud, and where there were no footprints, there were berries along the trail. Astalir sampled them along his way, to make sure they were from Gra’s bag. They tasted like deer carcass, so yep, they were from Gra’s bag. Unfortunately, because of Reesu, he knows what deer carcass tastes like. He will never truly forgive her for that.

Gale rode Astalir all the way down the trail, granting him Shield of Faith to help him escape any random encounters along the way.

Finally they got to the end of the trail: the beach that Captain Johnny used to park his ship. Unfortunately, it was nowhere to be seen.

Astalir set down Gale. He swished his head around, lighting up the ends of his antler tines. The beach water responded by floating up as a bubble, then elongating as it stretched into a cylinder. It floated up to Astalir’s eye, and he looked through it. Changing the shape of the front and back slightly, he adjusted it to see far away.

Out there on the fabric of the sea, a small dot appeared. It was boat-shaped, because it was a boat. And on that boat, stood three figures on the deck. Captain Johnny stood at the wheel, a white shirtless wolf howled in the crow’s nest, Reesu splashed in puddles on the deck, and there was Gra, leaning on the railing, staring back at Astalir.

=======

Gra sighed. “Reesu, I have a question.”

“Yes, my hunk?”

Gra sighed.

She spat out water like a fountain onto the deck, mopping it around with her foot.

“Why me?”

“Why not you?”

“I mean, you go away for 15 years, and you don’t even write.”

“I don’t write, that’s true.”

“So why me? Why did you feel like I was the perfect one? Surely you’ve met better candidates in that 15 years?”

Reesu’s playful water dropped suddenly to the floor as she hung her head. She looked to the side. Then, as suddenly as it had stopped, the waterworks jumped back to life. “Of course not, my hunk! You’re the best there is, and I want *you*. You should be honored to be chosen for this!”

“Hmmm…” Gra nodded contemplatively.

=======

Astalir lowered his water telescope.

“Do yous see them?” Gale asked.

Astalir turned the water telescope to ice, and dropped it in Gale’s hand.

“Oh! I sees them! They are on boat! They is has Reesu too!”

“We have to get to them.” Astalir said.

“But how? Gale is yinglet and yinglet no swim.”

“We’ll walk.”

“How is possible, there is too many water…”

Astalir hoisted Gale up onto his antlers and charged forward, jumping off the beach into the water below. But his antlers lit up, and the water beneath his hooves turned to ice. He slipped a little bit. “Gale!”

“I has got you.” Gale touched a hand down onto the top of Astalir’s head. “This yinglet has guided you! What is doing? Don’t waste time! Go!”

“Thanks, buddy.” Astalir ran forward, turning the water to ice as he went.

Gale held the ice telescope. “We get closer! Keep up the running!”

Astalir’s heart surged with hope. He was going to rescue his friend.

“When we get to boat, what we do? How to stop wolf who kidnap Gra and Reesu?”

Astalir was silent.

“Deer friend? How we stop wolf?”

“Gale, there’s something I didn’t tell you.”

“What deer friend not tell Gale? Deer friend have secret?”

“It’s not the wolves who kidnapped Gra.”

“Gale confused. If wolf not kidnap Gra, then who?”

“Gale, I need you to promise me something. Promise me you’ll help me rescue Gra, no matter who it was that kidnapped him.”

Gale was silent.

“Gale?”

“Gaaah!” Gale frantically climbed up the back of Astalir’s antlers.

“Gale!” Astalir stopped in his tracks, standing firm on the sheet of ice he most recently made, but slowly slipping. He tugged on Gale’s tail.

“Deer friend no tell Gale we fight Reesu!”

“Gale! I need you!”

“Gale no fight Reesu. Reesu too strong! Drown Gale!”

“Gale, please. I can’t do this without you.”

“Drown Gra, drown deer, drown Gale!” Gale desperately tried in vain to escape his perch in Astalir’s antlers, but Astalir moved them around and held him in place with his telekinesis.

“Gale please!” Astalir’s legs spread apart as he slowly slipped.

“Gale no want die! Reesu kidnap Gra, Deer kidnap Gale!”

Astalir’s heart sank. The last thing he wanted was for something bad to happen to Gra, especially at the hands of Reesu. And the second-to-last thing he wanted, was to be compared to *her*.

Astalir took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, Gale. I shouldn’t have deceived you. You are a good friend and I won’t force you to come with me.”

Gale stopped squirming. “What deer friend saying?”

Astalir lowered his antlers, setting Gale on the patch of ice. He slipped all the way onto his belly as he did so. Struggling to get back up, he continued. “I can take you back to the shore. I don’t want to force you to do something you don’t want to do. Reesu… she’s a great and terrible force. And if I have to face her alone, so be it. I won’t hold any ill will against you. But this is something I have to do, for Gra.”

Gale looked down for a moment. “Gale want go back…” He fidgeted with his fingers. “But Gale no want deer friend be sad. No want Gra in danger.”

“It’s ok, Gale let’s take you back to safety. We found Gra once, we can do it again.” Astalir walked back to shore, slipping frequently.

“Gaaah!” Gale pulled at his hair. “Gale do stupid thing! Crazy thing!”

“Gale?”

“Gale is brave yinglet!” He jumped up and climbed up Astalir to his antlers. “Eat the bread! Gale is in!”

Astalir jumped for joy. “Let’s go!” He charged back towards the bread—I mean the boat.

As Astalir ran forward, constructing an ice bridge as he went, Gale navigated with the ice telescope, pointing Astalir in the direction of the boat.

“Deer friend?”

“What is it Gale?”

“You have plan?”

“Uh… of course I do!” Astalir grunted. “No, I’ve got nothing.”

“Gale understand, plan is secret.”

“Yeah…” Astalir contemplated what he could do. He thought back to what Reesu had done to evade the bandits, and what she had done to evade him when exiting the tavern. “Aha! Gale, I think I got it!”

“No need to tell Gale, Gale just shield and heal.”

“Hang on tight, things are going to get hard to see.”

“What deer friend mean… GAAAH!”

Astalir’s antlers strobed, and as they did, Astalir’s hooves vanished from existence, then his legs, and his tail. He was a floating bean of a deer, until that bean of a body vanished as well.

“Deer friend disappear! Deer friend disappear!” Gale squirmed.

“Don’t worry, Gale, it’s part of the plan.” Astalir winked up at him as his head also vanished, leaving just his one winking eye. Then it, too, disappeared.

Gale grabbed onto the floating disembodied antlers while he could. “Deer friend no leave Gale!”

The antlers disappeared too, but Gale didn’t lose his grip.

“What Gale floating on?” Gale looked down at his hand. It gripped something, but he couldn’t see it. Then his hand disappeared. “*Gale* disappear *too*!” He screamed.

Then, in one swipe, his whole body disappeared.

“Gale, invisible?”

“Yep, a little trick I learned from Reesu.”

“We have the fighting chance now!” Gale exclaimed.

“We have to be quiet now.” Astalir shushed. Silently, they approached the boat.

=======

Gra stared out at the ocean. “I wonder what Astalir will do when he finds I’m gone?”

“Look at this!” Reesu called out to Gra.

Gra turned around to glance at Reesu. She was doing a trick with water where it looked like she was juggling three water balls, but they were moving in unrealistic patterns. “Wow, that’s neat.” He said unenthusiastically. He looked back out at the water. He saw something in the distance.

“What about this?”

This time Reesu was doing twirls in the middle of a stylized water tornado.

“Well, would you look at that.” Gra said as he turned back to the water. Something flashed in the distance. Then it got closer, and he could tell that it was ice! Ice forming its way to the boat! “Would you look at that!” He called out excitedly.

“Look at what?”

“Oh, your trick! It’s very lovely.”

“No, no, no… I wasn’t born yesterday. What are you looking at?”

“Nothing.” Gra shrugged.

“Let me see.” Reesu pushed past Gra to see out there.

“No.” Gra stood in her way and tried to cover her eyes.

She pushed him away so she could see, but concentrating on him kept her from being able to focus.

“Land ahoy!” The shirtless white wolf in the crow’s nest called out.

“Land ahoy?” Captain Johnny asked. “We’re not supposed to reach Canadia for another day or two!”

“Well whatever it is, it’s reaching us! And fast!”

“What!” Reesu threw Gra overboard and focused on the horizon. She spotted a trail of ice rapidly freezing its way to the boat. She squinted her eyes at it. “Astalir!”

Gra floated up and out of the water, getting deposited on the deck by a watery tentacle.

“Gra! You dimwit! You led Astalir right to us!”

“Reesu, I don’t know how to tell you this, but I don’t want to go with you.”

Reesu slapped him. “I already knew that!” She crossed her arms and pouted. “But you didn’t have to say it out loud…”

“It’s ok, Reesu. I’ll just forget that this ever happened and we can go back to being friends again. Astalir and I will continue the mission, and—”

“No!” Reesu yelled. “You and Astalir aren’t doing anything together! You and *I* are going to do stuff together!”

Gra stood back.

“I can’t believe you led Astalir right to us.”

“Did you expect him to not find us? You had to have known he’d find us eventually, he’s a smart deer.”

Reesu laughed. “Smart, you say? Well it wasn’t very smart of him to try and challenge me, on the ocean no less! Because, you see, I *control* the ocean.”

She raised up her hands and her tentacles became visible. They crackled with energy as storm clouds gathered around her. The waves jumped higher and the water roughened, rocking the boat with nauseating force.

“Reesu! Please! No!”

“You leave me no choice, Gra. You should’ve told Astalir to fuck off! And leave you alone.”

“No! He doesn’t deserve it!”

“That little shit deserves everything that’s coming to him. He should’ve died a long time ago, with the rest of his race.”

“Reesu, please!” Gra got down on his hands and knees. “I’ll do anything you ask, just spare his life!”

“Don’t worry, you will anyways.” Reesu smiled. “Goodbye, Astalir, it was nice playing with you.”

With a push of her arms and tentacles, she commanded the ocean. It responded by swelling up into a giant wave, taller than any wave Gra had ever seen, taller than any building, even. Higher than the Aarakroca was flying when Reesu threw a wolf at it. Higher than Sui had ever flown with his new dragon wings. Higher than Gale had ever gotten. Higher than Astalir had ever floated in his bubble coat. It was the tallest wave ever.

And it came crashing down on top of the ice path. It crushed it to shards, splintering it in all directions. The giant wave turned to massive rapids that spun the ice shards in all directions, violently shaking it to pieces.

The remnants of the ice path were no more. There was no evidence they were even there. No more ice formed, and nothing was left.

“For good measure.” An ocean wave sprung up behind the boat and washed towards where the ice path had been, pushing what would have remained far, far away. Never to return.

“Astalir! Astaliiiir!” Gra yelled, grabbing onto the railing and vaulting over it. “I’ll save you buddy!”

Reesu pulled him back. “No, Astalir, there will be no saving you this time. Gra is a little… bit tied up at the moment.” She dropped Gra on the deck.

He slouched forward, drowning his face in his hands. “As… Astalir…”

“Are you… crying?” Reesu scoffed.

“He was my friend. I swore to protect him. I swore to him that nothing bad would happen to him. I failed him.” He pounded the floor. “This shouldn’t have happened.”

“You’re right, it shouldn’t have.” Reesu stood over Gra. “But you had to tell him where we were going, didn’t you? You’re such a fool, Gra.”

Gra looked up at Reesu, an angry tear in his eye.

Reesu laughed. “An April Fool!”
