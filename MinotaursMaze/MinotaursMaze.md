# The Minotaur’s Maze

This is a novelization of a D&D campaign, told more or less from the perspective of my character, Astalir.

# Chapter 1 – Good Hunting

A robot, a bugbear, and a dragonborn walk into a bar.

The bartender, a bearded dwarf, cleans a glass. “What can I get for you, dragon-looking dude?”

The dragonborn leans his staff against the counter. “Sweet tea, please.”

The dwarf cusses in dwarfish as he fills a cup. “That’ll be 1 silver.”

“Here.” The dragonborn plinks down a gold piece.

“He doesn’t have any silver.” The robot laughs under his breath to the bugbear.

The dragonborn looks his way. “Excuse me?”

“Thanks for the tip.” The dwarf pockets the gold.

“No I need change.” The dragonborn clarifies.

“And he’s strapped for cash.” The bugbear whispers to the robot.

“What was that?”

The robot and bugbear stop talking.

The bugbear turns to the dwarf. “I’ll have a water.”

“1 copper.” The dwarf produces a glass of water.

The bugbear searches through his coin purse. He grumbles as he hands the dwarf a gold piece.

The dragonborn chuckles. “Who doesn’t have a copper piece?”

“You want change?”

“Yes, please.” The bugbear grumbled.

“And is strapped for cash?” The dragonborn chuckles as he takes a sip of his sweet tea.

“Ignore him.” The robot squinted at the dragonborn. “I’ll have a cup of vinegar.”

“3 copper.”

The robot slides 3 copper from the bugbear’s pile over the counter.

The bugbear grumbles but continues pocketing the change.

The dwarf serves the drinks and the three sip up.

The bugbear orders a steak. The robot takes it without asking.

“Hey!” The bugbear growls. He bites the robot’s hand off. “My steak.” He chews and lets the robot’s hand sloppily fall out of his mouth.

The robot picks up his hand, reattaches it, and finds there’s meat all over it. “Mm! Steak!” The robot licks the meat off his hand.

The robot tries to steal more steak, but the bugbear slaps him away, and accidentally also hits the dragonborn.

“Hey!” The dragonborn breathes fire onto the bugbear, singing his head hair.

“How about I kill him right now?” The robot draws a dagger.

The bugbear growls.

“Enough! No brawling, no shanking, and absolutely NO fire breathing in my tavern!” The dwarf breaks up the fight.

Everyone calms down.

“Sorry, I’m not looking for trouble.” The dragonborn admits. “I’m just looking for a quest.”

“Well do I got a job for you ruffians.” The dwarf pulls out a map. “I need you to go to this location and find someone named Silvia. I’ll pay you 300gp.”

“300 gold? Sure I’ll do it.”

“We’ll join you.” The robot volunteers.

“No, thank you.”

“You’ll need the help.” The dwarf agrees. “You might need more adventurers.”

“Ok, fine.” The dragonborn walks away with the map.

“Hold on! That map costs 3 silver!” The dwarf yells.

The dragonborn pays for it. As the robot and bugbear follow him out, a mysterious figure sits in a corner watching them.

They walk to a church of Almainter, the God of Sun and Law. As they get there, the church lets out. The congregation pours out and the cleric appears to close the doors.

This cleric is also a dragonborn, and has glorious green scales.

The dragonborn walks up to him and slaps him.

The cleric dodges and shouts, “Hey! That’s attempted assault! By the law, you are hereby banned from this church!”

The dragonborn pulls his hand back. “Sorry. I’m looking for Silvia. Is she here?”

“Who’s asking?”

The party tells him about the dwarf’s quest and they go back to the tavern. As they leave the church, a peasant appears along the wall scrubbing the pure white walls.

Back at the tavern, the cleric asks the dwarf about this quest. The dwarf explains it, and the cleric writes up a contract. After it’s made official, the dwarf throws the contract into the bag of 300 gold. It’s made clear that the 300 gold is for the whole party, and not for each individual member.

They leave the tavern. As they leave, an old man in tattered robes holds out a tin cup. “Alms for the poor?”

“Look at this poor old man.” The robot remarks.

“Here, have this.” The bugbear throws a bone with meat on it into the cup.

“Thank you, young man.” The old man takes the bone and starts chewing. “Very crunchy.”

“You better not be causing any kind of disturbance out here.” The cleric scolds. “Or I’ll arrest you for loitering.”

“Well how about he joins the party?” The bugbear suggests. “Then he won’t be loitering.”

“Are you good at adventuring, old man?” The robot leans over.

“Do I look like I am?” The old man shows his arm. It’s all skin and bones.

“No.”

The old man holds out a hand. “Help me up?”

“Ok, I see. You are not fit for adventuring.”

“Maybe he has some wise words of wisdom?” The bugbear asks. “What’s your wisdom?”

“Don’t sniff your finger after you poop.”

“Good enough for me.” The bugbear picks him up. Some of the old man’s clothes clip through the bug bear’s fur, but no one notices.

“Oh, are you taking me home?”

“If you want.”

“He has a home?” The robot asks.

“Do you?”

“It’s over there.” The old man points.

The bugbear follows the old man’s pointers to behind the tavern. There’s two trees behind the tavern with a rope tied between them. A tarp hangs on the rope.

“Here you go.” The bugbear puts the old man in the tree.

“Thanks, young bear man.” The old man gnaws on the bone.

“Here, be dignified. Use this.” The robot hands the old man a dagger.

The old man cuts the bone into 4 pieces and hands the dagger back. “Thanks.”

“Ok, let’s get on with the quest.” The dragonborn pushes the party onward.

The party journeys out of town, following the map. The dragonborn leads them into a forest in the middle of the wilderness. They hear a handpan musical instrument playing next to a river. They approach the sound, and find a firbolg sitting on a rock.

The robot claps loudly. It sounds like pots and pans banging together. “Very lovely. Do you want to go on an adventure with us?”

“Oh hello.” The firbolg sets down his instrument. “I suppose I could go on an adventure. What kind?”

“Dungeoneering. We need to find someone.” The robot climbs on the bugbear’s back.

The firbolg shrugs. “I’m not sure.”

The bugbear pulls out a flute. “I really like your music. I also play an instrument.” The bugbear plays a tune.

Jodi applauds. “Very nice song. You all seem like very nice people. I think I will come along.”

“Ok, great. Let’s get on with the mission.” The dragonborn pounds his staff on the ground.

“By the way, I’m Jodi. I’m a firbolg.”

“New friend!” The bugbear picks up Jodi. “I’m Micro.”

The robot nods.

“What’s your names?” Jodi asks.

“Silber Posten.” The robot announces.

“Dralth.” The cleric states.

“I’m Trent.” The dragonborn looks at the map. “And I’m trying to use this map to see where we’re going.”

“What do we have here?” Silber the robot looks through his scope and spies a deer across the river.

The deer drinks water from the river under the shade of an oak tree. Its antlers are large and glorious.

“What a beauty you are.” Silber takes his rifle and aims it at the deer.

“Hold on, don’t kill it!” Jodi protests.

“Fine, I won’t.” Silber shoots the deer. The bullet hits its antler, breaking it off near the base. “I just wanted its horn anyway.”

“It’s called an ‘antler’.” Dralth the cleric corrected.

Jodi looked on, mouth agape.

Dralth comforted him. “It’s legal, see? It’s a buck. It’s buck hunting season.”

“I guess.” Jodi agreed.

“Now just to go across the river and collect my antler.” Silber points Micro the bugbear across the river.

But before their eyes, the unexpected happened. The deer’s missing antler magically floats up into the air and reattaches itself to the deer’s head. The deer sprints away. the damaged antler jostles in place as it runs.

Micro carries Silber across the river.

“What the?” Silber examines the place the deer was. “That was weird.”

Jodi breathes a sigh of relief as he watches the deer escape. “Ok, these people don’t *kill* wild animals, so they’re still good people.”

Trent and Jodi also cross the river, leaving Dralth alone by himself.

A random owlbear appears!

Trent runs back across the river to escape. He picks up a rock, tosses it in the air, and magically propels it through the air to the owlbear.

The owlbear dodges it, and turns its rage to Trent. It crosses the river as if it was nothing, and swings a claw at Trent.

Dralth acts fast. He shines a bright light on the owlbear, causing it to miss Trent.

The owlbear lunges forward with its teeth, taking a big chunk out of Trent’s body. Thankfully it misses the map.

Silber takes his rifle and aims it at the owlbear. BANG! A bullet gets lodged in the owlbear’s head. The owlbear survives. “Giddyup! I gotta be the one to kill him!” He prods Micro to run along the river towards the owlbear.

Micro the bugbear wields his polearm, which is a really long weapon. So long, in fact, that he can reach across the entire river and hit the owlbear. The owlbear turns to Micro just in time to see Micro scream and project an image of a spectral bear around him.

Dralth shines another light in the owlbear’s face. This one is a searing scorching ray of light. It fries the owlbear’s brain and it falls over dead.

Trent holds his gut. It bleeds profusely. “How am I going to complete this quest now?”

Out of nowhere, 2 brown bears appear behind Jodi.

Jodi speaks in a pleasant voice to the bears. “Hey, we’re all friends here. Go on about your day and we’ll go on about ours. Does that sound good?”

The bears calm down and walk away.

Jodi contemplates the situation. “Ok, they killed the owlbear mercilessly, but it’s a monster. They are good people for taking it out before it hurts people. They’re good people. They let the brown bears go about—"

“Ooh! Aren’t you a beaut!” The robot takes his rifle and shoots one of the bears. It dies instantly. “Score!”

Jodi’s mouth falls agape. “Ok, maybe they’re hungry?”

“This bear is mine! Yogi Bear demands it!” Micro roars and charges at the other living bear. “No one else is allowed to attack it! I’m so blood thirsty!”

Micro thrusts his polearm straight into the bear’s side. The bear bleeds out and roars.

“You can’t tell me what to do!” Trent takes a moment to cast a spell, ignoring his wound. “Jim’s Magic Missile!” He shoots three glowing projectiles at the bear, pelting it in its side, but not doing much.

“You ruined my challenge!” Micro angrily declares.

The brown bear, enraged, attacks Micro and severely wounds him.

A fly wanders into Jodi’s agape mouth.

Micro shanks the bear dead. “I challenged the bear! You ruined my challenge!” Micro ran across the river towards Trent.

“Oh crap.” Trent runs away. “Magnify Gravity!” He casts it on the ground on Micro, but Micro shakes it off like it was nothing, even though he gets a scratch and Silber gets a scratch. “Oh crap!”

“You’re mine!” Silber takes his rifle and shoots Trent in the leg.

“Oh shit!” Trent falls face first into the mud.

Micro stalks closer to Trent.

“Hold on!” Dralth the cleric puts up a hand. “Killing him is illegal.”

Jodi takes a deep breath. “Good. The cleric will stop them from killing him, and he will get healed. They’re not all bad people.”

Silber pulls out a scroll from his bag. “He’s my target.”

Dralth reads over the scroll. It says that there’s a bounty on this dragonborn and that Silber is a licensed bounty hunter. “Mm. So it is legal. Carry on.” He hands back the scroll.

Jodi sweats.

Micro stabs Trent through the chest, pinning him to the ground.

Trent breathes heavily, trying to stay alive.

Silber hops off Micro and lands hard on Trent’s back. He takes his dagger and slices Trent’s dragon head clean off his shoulders. “Bounty acquired!” Silber presents his prize. He bags it.

Jodi almost faints. He goes invisible and runs away. “These are NOT good people! The cleric lets anything happen, the bugbear attacks anything that moves, and the robot is a MURDERER.” Jodi breathes rapidly out of control. “I can’t… I can’t take this…”

CRUNCH

A deer appears out of the woods. It leans down to take a bite of grass.

Jodi calms down. “Oh hello.”

The deer turns to him. It continues chewing. The antler jiggles weirdly as it does so. A crack is very visible near the base.

“Oh, you’re the deer the robot shot. Are you hurt?” Jodi crouched and approached the deer. “Come here, boy.”

The deer approached and knelt his head down. It sniffed Jodi’s hand.

“That’s it, come here.” Jodi holds the deer’s head. “Oh you poor boy. Here, let me help you with that.” Jodi rips a piece of his clothes and ties it up on the antler. “There you go.”

The antler was strapped in place. The deer backed up and moved its head all around. The antler stayed in place. The deer looked at him and smiled.

“I’m glad you like it.” Jodi breathed a happy sigh. “I’m glad you’re better.”

“Thank you so much!” The deer spoke.

“Ah!” Jodi jolted.

“I really appreciate it. I wouldn’t want to have to wait another season for them to grow back.”

“Oh, no worries.” Jodi regained his composure. “You talk?”

“Ah, yes, I am a Deerkin, a sentient deer species.”

“I’ve heard of you. I haven’t ever seen your kind before.”

“We… stay hidden. Most of the time.”

“Well it’s nice to see you.” Jodi hugged the deer. “Am I sure glad to see you. And see that you’re ok.” Jodi cried onto the deer’s shoulder.

“Is everything… ok?”

“It is now.” Jodi nodded. “Can I ask you a question?”

“Yes.”

“Are people all bad?”

The deer squinted and sighed. “I’ve found that people, on the whole, are good. But there’s always a hoof-ful of people that are so bad that they bring the average down.”

Jodi cried even harder.

“But they’re mostly good. Like you!” The deer nuzzles Jodi’s backside. “You bring the average way way up. So just, keep your chin up, yeah? Things will get better.”

“Thank you.” Jodi wiped some tears from his eyes. “I’m Jodi, by the way. I’m a firbolg.”

“I know what you are. And I am Astalir the Deer.”

“It’s nice to meet you Astalir.”

“You too, Jodi, you too.”

# Chapter 2 – The Minotaur’s Maze

Apparently at some point, the party captured Astalir and tied him up with a rope so he couldn’t escape. They traveled together to the dungeon. Astalir tried using his tricks to escape, but they found him everytime. They tried talking to him, but all he would say was, “BLEAT!” He didn’t feel like he could trust them to know that he could talk. They all thought he was just a magical deer.

The party walks along until they find a traveling merchant. “Hello, fellow travelers!” The merchant greets them. “Care to test your luck?”

Sui, a dragonborn that recently joined the party, shrugged. “Why not?”

“Great!” The merchant rubbed his hands together excitedly. “I have many decks for you to choose from!”

“Did you just say the deck of many things?” Silber Posten asked.

“No, I said ‘many decks’. And those decks are: the magical deck, the weapon deck, the fancy deck, and last but not least: the random oddities deck.”

“Ooh what’s in the random oddities deck?” Sui asked.

“Draw a card and see.”

Sui takes a card. The card twists morphs in his hand into a mug of fresh hot coffee. The handle landed perfectly in his hand so he held it steadily. Sui breathed the smell in. “Coffeeeee…” He sighed, letting out a little bit of fire into the cup. He gulped it down. His eyes widened and stature rose. “Wow! I feel great!”

“Ah yes, the coffee cup of energizing. A most coveted oddity, for sure.” The merchant hands the deck of oddities to Silber.

“This looks like a good deck to draw from.” Silber draws a card. The card puffs into a cloud of air and surrounds Silber’s face. “What the…”

“The oddity of waterbreathing, truly a classic.” The merchant turns to Micro the bugbear.

“Me want hit things.” Micro grabs a card from the weapon deck. The card turns into a bomb with a laughing face drawn on it. “What do?”

The merchant cackles. “Let’s just say… it’s great for when your jokes don’t land.”

The merchant looks at Astalir for a brief second. Astalir takes the opportunity to take a card from the magical deck, which he happened to know was actually the deck of many things. The card he drew vanished and he with it.

The party gasped, trying to figure out where Astalir went.

The merchant shrugged. “He got teleported to the minotaur’s dungeon. He’ll be safe there until the minotaur comes to collect him.”

In the dungeon, Astalir sat in a cage. He looked around the dark room with his nightvision. There was a chest on the other side of the room. He couldn’t reach it with his hooves because of the cage. The cage was made of iron and couldn’t be effected by Astalir’s reality warping abilities. At least not yet. He examined the lock. It was an ordinary lock that he could very easily pick.

Footsteps.

Astalir was now aware he wasn’t alone. Perhaps this cage was designed to keep him in, but it could also keep whatever is out there out. He could use it for protection.

He surmised that he was in the minotaur’s maze somewhere. The party would come eventually to raid the maze. He had hoped that the party could be the distraction he needed to go in undetected, but now he knew that they could not be trusted.

He shrugged. Might as well use the cage while he cast Comprehend Languages. He waited until the cast time was over to unlock the cage. He found a treasure chest in the room with him. It had a nameplate on it that simply read, “Sandwich”. He picked the lock and opened the chest. It was empty, save for a single sandwich.

As he picked it up, it suddenly started glowing blue. What kind of magic was this? Whatever it was, he’d have to take it back to someone that knew how to detect magic. He wasn’t about to bite into a magical sandwich without knowing what it did. He pocketed the sandwich and took it with him.

He explored the maze, taking note of all the booby traps. He marked a red X on the ground where all the booby traps were. The maze was also riddled with monsters of all kinds. Astalir easily outsmarted them with his illusions. While they were chasing fake deer, he was running around. He led a few of them into the booby traps they were supposed to be guarding. He snuck around a lot too, staying in the shadows when possible.

Finally he searched all the rooms and didn’t find any documents. All rooms except one. He found a secret passage that led into a lobby with other rooms branching out from it. He ventured in, sensing the presence of a powerful being. And the presence—or lack there of—of magic. An antimagic field. His illusions didn’t work inside. And the room had next to no cover. The being inside was a huge minotaur—the huge minotaur.

Astalir turned back and went back to the cave entrance. A group of skeletons followed him, and this time he couldn’t shake them. He ran all the way back to the cage and locked it. The skeletons left him alone.

Fine. As much as he distrusted the party, he would need them to go in and take the brunt of the hits for him if he was going to get to the documents. He was sure the documents were in the unexplored rooms just past the antimagic field.

He waited for hours, but finally, the party did come.

“Deer!” Micro the bugbear ran up to the cage and hugged it. “Don’t worry! I free you!” Micro squeezed the cage tight, but instead of freeing Astalir, he just decreased the amount of space he had inside.

“BLEEEAT!” Astalir cried, trying to get him to stop.

“Skeletons!” Sui exclaimed, getting into battle positions. “They’re mine! I challenge them!”

“Did I hear someone say challenge?” Micro dropped the cage and stood at the doorway to the room with the skeletons. “Sui, you may not leave until you have defeated the skeletons.”

Sui nodded as he readied his bow.

“And everyone else? No one enters this room until the skeletons are dead. And no one except Sui can hit the skeletons!”

The party agreed.

Sui used the space to fire a volley of flaming arrows at the three skeletons in the room. He shot one, knocking its head off. He shot another one, shattering its arm bone. The skeletons fought back with mocks and cackles, but Sui shrugged them off. He was too focused to worry about the skeletons taunts. He was very handily defeating them.

The party had agreed to not interrupt this epic battle, but Astalir didn’t hear Micro. When Micro was announcing the challenge, Astalir was unlocking the cage and opening it when Dralf jumped on him.

“I’m going to ride you deer!” Dralf kicked his side. “Giddyup!”

Astalir bucked wildly and finally got Dralf to get off. Dralf stammered backward to regain his balance. Yep, this party was crazy. Astalir ran off to avoid Dralf, running deeper into the maze. He unknowingly crossed the threshold that Micro had laid down.

“Deer! Get back here!” Micro tripped Astalir with his polearm.

Astalir crashed into the ground. A flaming arrow shot over his head, just missing his antlers. Astalir skidded to a halt, getting serious rug burn. Micro grabbed him and pulled him back out of the room.

“I said no one is to enter! Stay put.” Micro plopped the wounded deer behind him and continued to guard the threshold.

The skeletons mocked Sui, making him lose confidence. But Micro encouraged him, and he won. He exploded the final skeleton and learned a new trick when fighting with a bow that allowed him to attack faster. Sui high-fived Micro.

The party took a short rest. Astalir licked his wounds and got up.

“BLEEEAT!” Astalir gestured for the party to follow him through the maze, but they split up and went searching down paths that had already been searched.

Micro somehow found out about the sandwich that Astalir found and hunted him down.

Astalir smiled when he saw him, but ran in fear when he heard what he said.

“Give me sandwich! Or else!”

Astalir ran away, running for a trap. If he could dodge it, maybe Micro would step on it and get slowed.

But Micro was too fast, and caught Astalir by surprise. He grabbed him and kept him from escaping. “Where sandwich?” Micro felt around Astalir. Astalir’s true form was on display, but he hid the fact that he was wearing armor and a backpack. Micro felt around inside Astalir’s invisible backpack. “I know deer have. But where?”

“BLEEEAT!”

“I speak bleat, too.” Micro’s tongue glowed and stretched. It took the form of a deer’s tongue. “BLEAT!” (“Where sandwich?”)

Astalir was taken aback. “BLEEAT!” (“You speak deer?”)

Micro responded in deer, “I speak all animal languages. Now where sandwich?”

“Oh, you mean this sandwich?” Astalir telekinetically floated the sandwich out of his bag and over a trap. “What do you want with it?”

“Need to bring back party member.”

“Who?”

“Robot sniper guy. He drew bad card, he become sandwich.”

Astalir’s eyes widened, and he smiled. “Oh. Maybe I *should* eat it then.”

“No! Give!” Micro jumped for the sandwich, catching it in his mouth. He fell into the trap. The floor gave out from under him. A deep pit threatened to swallow him whole. But Micro was strong. He clung to the edge and pulled himself onto the ledge. “So that what red mark mean.”

Astalir ran away. He didn’t want to be there when the killer robot was let loose again. Astalir ran to the lobby area and waited for the party to finally arrive.

Finally, they did. They were all battered and bruised from all the traps in the maze. They looked utterly exhausted, except for Sui, who was still energized from his morning coffee.

It didn’t matter. All Astalir need was a distraction so he could go find the documents. Once they entered the room, he had free reign to search the area. It didn’t mattered if they died, his mission could still be a success.

The party, consisting of Sui, Silber Posten, Micro, Dralf, and a big tanky dwarf, entered the minotaur’s room as expected. Astalir waited in the lobby.

“Who dares enter Timmy’s throne room?” The minotaur yelled in minotaur. “I, Timmy, will devour you all!”

Timmy roared with all his might as the party collapsed on him.

Silber Posten tried to charge a magical shot but the sniper round came out as just a normal bullet. “It’s an antimagic field!” He ran for cover.

“Huh?” Sui turns to watch Silber Posten flee as he pulls his arrow back. He tries to engulf his arrow in flames, but instead pulls a muscle and drops the arrow. He loads another arrow and pulls back, pushing through his new weird muscle pain. But he pulls too far and his bow string snaps. “Crap! Now I gotta repair this!” He retreats to a side room. For safety.

The big dwarf, Dralf, and Micro rush Timmy, overwhelming him with weapon damage.

But Timmy is no push over: he strikes the dwarf and severely wounds him.

The party is doing exactly what they need to. What they need to for Astalir to complete his mission. He rushes into a side room and ransacks it. No documents, but he did find a treasure chest with some writing on it. “Treasure” it said. Nope, not what he was looking for. Astalir ran for the other side room.

Meanwhile, the battle raged on. The three melee party members crowd around him and draw his focus.

This gives Silber an opportunity to strike very precisely. He aims for Timmy’s eye and hit dead center.

But Timmy noticed it and used a wind rune to redirect the attack. It hit Micro square in the face. He didn’t take any damage from the bullet, but it bought Timmy time to counterattack. Timmy crippled the dwarf. The dwarf limped onto the ground.

Sui retreated during all this into the room that Astalir hadn’t yet searched. He found a document labeled “Timmy’s Weaknesses” and started reading it aloud. “Timmy is weak to snipers and mages. Thus, the antimagic field and numerous walls and pillars.”

Timmy heard this and grew enraged. He ran toward Sui to stop him.

Micro chased Timmy and safeguarded Sui’s exit.

Sui ran away, carrying the documents as he ran.

Timmy angrily activated his final form. He grew twice as big and healed some of his wounds. He attacked Micro with his full force, badly wounding him.

But Silber got another good shot onto him, which allowed Micro an opportunity to stun him.

Micro swept his legs and knocked Timmy prone. One more shot would kill him.

Astalir saw that the party was not doing what they were supposed to. They were stealing the documents! Astalir ran by Sui and sneakily grabbed the documents, and ran to the room where the other secrets were. He saw Timmy on the ground and thought it was safe to run past. But he was wrong.

Timmy was not dead, just on the ground. He swung his axe as Astalir ran past, slicing the deer in the chest. Astalir flew to his landing spot but didn’t land on his legs. He bled out. He had safely landed just outside the antimagic field, which meant he could use his powers. He shaped the water in his blood to flow back into his wound, and he molded the earth beneath him to cover his wounds up. It took all his focus to concentrate on this task as he lay there, hoping the party would kill Timmy so that he might live.

And the party did so. Silber’s bullet flew through the air and killed the prone minotaur. Timmy was no more.

Astalir watched with heavy eyes.

The party found that the throne was actually a door and slid it to the side. Underneath was a huge pile of gold.

“We’re rich!” They exclaimed. “This is much more than that measley 600 gold that centaur Max had promised us!”

They carried the gold and the wounded dwarf out of the maze.

But they left the dying deer in the room to die.

Astalir concentrated, steadying his breathing and focusing on his reality bending. It was all he could do to just stay alive.

Stupid minotaur. He was on the ground, probably dead. But no, he had enough in him to get one last strike on this poor deer. This poor deer who had been hunted by this party the whole time. They had just been an inconvenience to him. The whole time. And now they probably got him killed.

But Astalir didn’t have time to focus on how much he distrusted the party and how glad he was that Timmy was dead. It turns out that there were some monsters the party hadn’t killed. And they came to investigate Timmy’s death, now that the party had left.

Astalir thought fast. He put up an illusion wall so they wouldn’t see, but included a crack in it big enough for him to see through. The skeletons carried Timmy away through the maze, not paying attention to Astalir or his wall. Stupid skeletons. But at least his illusion worked.

Several hours later, Astalir’s condition stabilized. He let the earth regain its shape, and his blood didn’t leak out anymore. He sighed in relief. He was still in terrible shape, and likely had internal bleeding still, but at least he could move around without losing any blood.

He scoured the room for documents and gathered all that he could find. Satisfied with his haul, he ventured into the maze. The skeletons were too busy tending to Timmy for them to notice Astalir sneaking through.

Astalir got out of the maze and collapsed. Is this the end? He can’t seem to go any further. At least he retrieved the secret documents from the minotaur’s maze. He could rest easy knowing he exposed these evil secrets. He took one last glance at the setting sun, then closed his eyes.

The cool breeze blew over his wound, making him cringe in pain. His ears flitted about, and his tail flapped.

“Deer!” A familiar voice came from afar. Footsteps approached. The warmth of an old friend. “Don’t worry, I got you.” The warm hug of a morning sun pulsated onto Astalir’s belly. His wound seeled up properly, and his organs stopped hurting.

Astalir opened his eyes. It was someone he recognized! “Jodi!” Astalir lept onto his feet and licked him with his long deer tongue. His tail wagged back and forth.

“Astalir!” Jodi exclaimed. “I’m so glad you’re alright!” He hugged him around the neck. “What happened?”

“That party was a real pain.”

“I’m glad I left.”

“Yeah but I needed them to fulfill my mission.”

“And what was that mission?"

“To expose these secrets to the world.” Astalir floated a pile of documents to Jodi.

“Body count for the year 1672, 1673… This is a count of how many people he’s eaten!”

Astalir nodded. “Hopefully this will bring some peace to the families who lost loved ones in there.”

Jodi nodded. “You did good work, Astalir.”

“Thank you.” Astalir wagged his tail. “Wanna go get some fruit or something?”

“Sure, I know a really good berry patch.”

Astalir and Jodi hung out a bit before Astalir had to go fulfill his mission. Lots of people found out about the extent of the minotaur’s body count. It led to new policy being implemented to prevent minotaur deaths in the future. Now for Astalir, it was a job well done. And now it was onto the next mission.

# Chapter 3 – The Goblin Camp

Sui the dragonborn dragon warden held the deck of random oddities in his hand. The morning sun reflected off the protective coating on the top card. Everyone was asleep, but since Micro the Bugbear had bought this deck for Sui, he couldn’t sleep. He drew a card that made it so he can rest without sleeping. Now he has to find ways to occupy his time while everyone sleeps.

He shrugged. “Why not?” He knew the risks, but he was bored. He shuffled the deck of random oddities and pulled the top card off the deck.

His stomache filled with butterflies that flitted about inside, giving him a bad stomache ache. They moved down his intestines and after a long, painful journey, made their way to his rear. He jumped out of his bed and pulled his drawers down. Three fairy-winged pixies popped out his pooper and fluttered around his room, shooting fairy dust everywhere. His bow and arrows started floating in the arrow, flying all over the place as the pixies darted around.

Sui managed to open a window and shooing all the fairies out without losing too many arrows. When the pixies left, all the floating objects fell to the ground. One arrow cut him on the arm.

He bandaged it up.

He sat back down on his bed. It was still not time for the others to wake up. He looked at the deck of random oddities, and stuck it in the bedside drawer. “Not doing that again.”

But then he got bored. “Maybe just one more card.” He pulled the top card off the deck and shoved the deck back into the drawer.

He immediately felt nauseous. He went to the window, but vomited all over himself before he could get there. The arm bandage dissolved in his stomache acid, as did part of his clothes and some of the floor board. He got some acid on his scales, but instead of dissolving, it healed the cut he got from the arrow. He looked at it inquisitively. “This is interesting!”

He went down stairs and asked the tavern keeper if he had any acid. The tavern keeper directed him to the alchemist shop in town.

Sui hustled to the shop, taking note that a strange “wild” deer was staring at him… and following him. He eyed the deer, but the deer pretended not to see.

At the alchemist shop, Sui requested the shopkeeper to throw acid on him. After some deliberation, they obliged. As Sui predicted, the acid healed him instead of hurting him. He had gained the power of acid absorption. “Thanks deck of random oddities!”

The alchemist requested to draw card. Sui sold him a card for 1 gold piece. The shopkeeper drew the card and became confused. It was an unlucky card; it caused the shopkeeper to lose some intelligence. Temporarily, but still. Sui put the deck away for good for the day.

Before leaving the alchemist’s shop, Sui bought a few acid potions for self-healing. Then he shut the door behind him to go back to the tavern.

Along the way, he spotted that deer again. It was definitely following him, while at the same time pretending that he wasn’t following and that he wasn’t being seen. “I see you, deer.” Sui eyed him. The deer just turned away and ate some leaves.

Back at the tavern, Sui met up with Max the centaur, who had a quest for them. No one else from the party showed; they were too worn out or debilitated by the last adventure. Some were deaf, some were unable to talk, and some were just too tired from their fight with Timmy the Minotaur. So Sui was the only one available for this new quest Max had for them.

A goblin camp had kidnapped a centaur and bound him. Max wanted them to free him. So Sui grabbed his bow and acid potions and headed out.

A deer tried to follow him discretely, but it was very obvious. “Don’t you mess up this mission, deer!” The deer looked away and ate some grass.

Sui got to the goblin camp and climbed a tree to scout the situation. The centaur was bound in the opposite corner. The brush was too thick to sneak from behind; the only way to get to him was through the goblin camp. And in the camp, there were several goblins sitting at a table. One had special markings of him and was bossing everyone around as they ate their breakfast.

“These guys look dangerous. But if I have to go through them all, I will. Just stay out of my way, deer.”

The deer flicked his tail. He scraped an antler up against a tree and pulled off a piece of bark.

“Here we go.” From his treetop perch, Sui drew his bow and shot the goblin leader in the chest.

The goblin leader got up from the table yelling in pain. He ripped the arrow out of his chest, only for another one to stab him through the head. He collapsed to the ground.

The other goblins pointed at Sui and angrily drew their weapons, which was mostly bows and short swords. One goblin shot him in the shoulder. Another shot him in the gut. A third, panicked goblin pulled back his bow so far that the string broke. He looked at his bow in panicked shock. Then he looked at Sui just in time to see an arrow hit him in the face.

“Skill issue.” Sui said smugly.

The goblins all came running at Sui, more weapons at the ready. Sui realized he was in deep trouble. He couldn’t fight all these goblins alone. So he reached out to the only one here who wasn’t actively fighting him.

“Deer! Deer!”

The deer looked at him and cocked his head.

“I need you! Help me!”

The deer shrugged. A spark of light traveled up his antlers.

All of a sudden, Sui saw two left hands, two right hands, and two bows. “What the?” It was like he was splitting in two, like mitosis. But he didn’t feel any pain. The copy of him jumped out of the tree, ran at the goblins, and hid behind a tent.

Sui stared at it in bewilderment for a moment, until he realized that the goblins were just as confused. The goblins shoot their arrows at his clone, but they all go right through it, causing no damage. Some goblins rush to the clone and strike it with a melee weapon, also going through it and causing no damage.

“Well done, deer.” Taking this moment of relief, Sui pulls the arrows out of his body and pours acid on the wounds. They seal up perfectly, no pain. He draws his bow and shoots a goblin in the back. It falls over dead. He shoots another one.

The goblins realize they can’t kill the clone and that there’s another Sui, the real Sui, that can still bleed. They run up to the tree where Sui’s at, bow drawn. He shoots it right at Sui’s head.

Sui falls over off his branch and swings on it with one arm. The arrow whizzes past his face. He looses an arrow as he drops to the ground, hitting one square in the chest. He hides behind a bush and draws his bow. He can just barely see a goblin through the bush, and aims through it. His arrow spins through the air like a drill, pushing all the bush branches aside. It contacts the goblin’s forehead and caves in its skull, popping his head like a balloon. Goblin blood and brains blew everywhere.

Sui climbs back up the tree, using the tree as a shield as he climbs. The goblin arrows hit dead center in the tree. He shoots the remaining goblins and they fall to the ground. Now that there are no arrows flying past his face, he scouts the camp again from his perch.

All the goblins in he could see were laying on the ground dead. The table had food on it, and around it were several tents. Sui waited a bit to see if there was anything in the tents, if anything would come out of it.

Something did come out, but not from inside. A strange goblin walked out from behind a tent and unzipped the front, as if to go in. But then another goblin came out and yelled at the strange goblin to get lost. A burning coal from the morning cookout floated up and into the tent goblin’s pocket. His pants caught on fire and he ran around trying to put it out.

As he did so, the strange goblin entered the tent and rummaged around, throwing things out of the tent left and right. It appeared to be looking for something. Satisfied that nothing was there, the strange goblin left the tent and the firepants goblin and headed to the next tent.

And again, there was a goblin in that tent, too. This goblin kicked the strange goblin in the rear and yelled at him.

“So it seems that all these tents have goblins in them.” Sui squinted at the tents. “But I can’t see through them. I’ll have to wait for them to come out.”

As if reading his mind, his clone started to move again. It unequipped its bow and unsheathed its short sword. It walked menacingly toward the three goblins.

The strange goblin didn’t hesitate. It pulled out its short sword and ran at Sui’s clone, giving its best battlecry.

Sui drew his bow, but had a funny feeling he should hold back. “Let’s see what this clone is made of.”

The clone swung his sword at the strange, charging goblin. The goblin fell over backwards and dropped his sword. The clone plunged his sword into the goblin, and blood poured out of its wounds.

“Holy poop!” Sui let his bow down. “This clone is brutal!”

The clone turned its attention to the other two goblins who just got out of their tents. The firepants goblin was so scared, it not only peed itself, not only pooped itself, but also backed up and tripped over backwards over the breakfast fire pit. He passed out and burned alive.

The clone pointed his sword at the other goblin. That goblin turned tail and ran, tripping over the edge of the tent as he went. He escaped the camp into the woods.

The commotion woke up the rest of the goblins. A whole half dozen more goblins appeared out of the tents.

“Bingo!” Sui readied his bow.

The goblins are stared at Sui’s clone, trying to figure out what to do from a distance. One goblin approached and realized it wasn’t real, and called it out to the other goblins. But he stepped too close to the strange goblin that the clone straight up murdered, and all of sudden that goblin wasn’t dead anymore.

The strange goblin pulled out a dagger and stabbed the yelling goblin in the foot. It yelled out in pain.

“What the? Goblins can’t resurrect themselves, right?”

Another goblin came to help, and pointed at the strange goblin lying in a pool of blood on the floor. The jig was up.

The strange goblin dissolved to reveal the body of… the deer! The strange goblin had been the deer in disguise this whole time! And there wasn’t a scratch on him!

Sui chuckled. “Clever deer!” He drew his bow. “Don’t worry, I’ll get you out of there.” Sui shoots the goblin that exposed the deer’s true form. It fell over before it could get its weapon out.

That was all the opening the deer needed. It jumped over the fresh goblin corpse and dashed into a tent. It jumped out and ran to another tent.

The goblin next to it tried to stab it as it ran past, but the deer deflected the blade with its antler. The goblins then tried shooting the deer, but all their shots missed. The deer hid in the tent and they couldn’t see it anymore.

Sui shoots both the goblins that shot at the deer. Dead, dead. No there were no more goblins in the camp. “Well done, deer.”

Sui climbed out of the tree and inspected the goblin camp. Bodies lay everywhere. The breakfast food was ruined, unless you like your food with a side of blood and guts. The tents were all intact, except for the ones the deer ran through.

“What are you doing?” Sui watched as the deer ran into all the tents, kicked all the stuff out, and then ran to the next tent. The deer ignored him and continued doing what it was doing. “You’re definitely not a normal deer. Some kind of magic deer. I trust you know what you’re doing.”

“Mmm! Mmm!” The centaur lay on the ground gagged and bound.

Sui tried to untie him, but his fingers were too sore from shooting his bow. He couldn’t undo the knots. “Screw it.” He unlatched a potion bottle from his belt. “Careful, this might sting a bit.” He dripped acid out of the bottle onto the ropes. They dissolves away in a line that circumvented the need to undo knots.

“Thank you, my dear dragon.” The centaur spoke in Sylvan as he shook off the loose ropes. “I am freeeee!” The centaur ran off, jumping over the bloodied table as he ran.

Sui approached the table. The goblin leader lay on it, spilling his guts all over it. Sui patted him down, searching for valuables. He pulled out his scimitar, his shield, and some loose change. “This will be worth selling.” He examined them. Then he found a javelin. He looked at it coyly. “I’ve got an idea.”

Sui thrust the javelin into the ground and lifted the goblin leader’s body onto the opposite end. The body drifted down, skewered on the javelin pole. Sui clapped his hands together. “Let this be a message to all who mess with us!”

No one heard it. But they would see the skewered goblin, if they ever came to the camp. Not even the deer was paying attention.

Sui approached the tent the deer was in, holding his hands up to block flying items from hitting his face. “Deer?”

The deer stopped and looked at him.

“What are you doing?”

The deer squinted at him, then after a moment, shrugged. It walked next to him, as if to be petted. Its shoulder fur parted, revealing a map. The map detailed the where abouts of an encampment, and the inner tunnel system of a cave network. There was a date and timestamp written in the corner, freshly written.

“So you found this in these tents?”

The deer nodded. It looked at the ground. There was a falcata sword on the ground next to a bag of 50 gold. A spark of magic traveled up the deer’s antlers, and the sword and bag floated up into the air.

Sui held out his hand to receive. The sword floated along and into the deer’s fur, becoming completely concealed. The bag of gold disappeared similarly.

“Wait, you’re not sharing?”

The deer cocked its head, then shook it.

“What if I gave you a free card from the deck of random oddities?” Sui pulled the deck out of his pocket. “Only 1 gold!”

“BLEAT!” The deer yelled. It ran out of the tent.

Sui ran out after the deer, but tripped on a shiny helmet. “What? Why would the deer throw this out?” The helmet was really fancy. Sui realized that this tent must be the goblin leader’s tent. “Hmm…” He got an idea. He found all the fancy pieces of armor strewn around the camp and put them on. He laid down in the goblin leader’s tent and went to bed. “Can’t find me…” He yawned as he fell asleep.

# Chapter 4 – The Kobold Cave

The sun was coming up and his lips were getting chapped. After hours of walking through the night, it was a relief to finally find a tavern. Grarthta Swanfallow, a pale green 7ft half-orc, entered and ordered a beer. After taking some long, refreshing gulps, his stomache rumbled.

“Hungry? I can cook you up something.” The dwarf behind the counter said.

“You have meat?”

“Sure do. Would you like beef, chicken…”

“Do you have venison?” Gra licked his lips.

“I’ll check the back.” The dwarf put down the glass he was cleaning and went into the kitchen.

While he was gone, a dragonborn walked sleepily down the stairs and sat next to Gra. He nodded at him.

Gra nodded back.

The dragonborn yelled from his seat. “Hey! Anyone there! I’m hungry!”

“Wait just a bleeting minute!” The dwarf yelled from the back. Finally, he returned, empty-handed. “Sorry, we’re fresh out. We got beef though.”

Gra settled for beef and the dragonborn also order breakfast. They introduced themselves when Max came in. Gra found out the dragonborn’s name is Sui, with an *i*.

“Glad to see you both met already. Adventurers come and go, and this is your new partner, for now.” Max told the dragonborn. “We have a problem with a kobold cave. Here’s how to get there.” Max told them the info they needed to know and they left the tavern.

Outside, an old man was sitting next to the steps. “Aaalms for the pooor?” He held out a tin cup to Sui.

“This is my deer friend.” Sui told Gra.

“Well it’s your choice who you keep around.”

“No, *deer* friend. You know, hooves and antlers.”

“Deer?” Gra drooled. He tried looking at the old man’s face. “He looks human to me.”

“Come on, deer, drop the disguise. We know it’s you.”

“What?” The old man pulled his hands into his hood. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Come on, out with it.” Sui reached to grab the old man.

The old man ran off, but a deer showed up where he was sitting. It stood there, staring at Sui, rather crossly.

“See? I told you. Deer.” Sui grabbed onto the deer’s antlers, but his hand passed through them. “Your antlers aren’t real?”

“I’m gonna get me some deer!” Gra grappled the deer’s neck, but his arms passed through it and he fell to the ground. He swiped his hands through the deer’s body. “It’s an incorporeal deer? What kind of species is this?”

“Wait, have you been ethereal this whole time?” Sui started questioning his sanity. “I thought for sure I saw you interact with objects.”

The deer ignored them, pointing to and stomping on a piece of paper on the ground.

“What’s this?” Sui picked it up. It was a map of the kobold cave, with certain things circled.

“Something very useful to our mission.” Gra took it.

The deer disappeared.

Gra’s looked at the spot the deer once occupied. “Huh, that’s strange.”

Gra and Sui followed the directions that Max gave them to the kobold cave. Along the way, they found a bridge of ice going across a stream. It was weird because it was summer.

Gra looked and saw a deer eating some tree bark. “Deer!” He jumped across the river and ran at the deer. The deer just ran away. Gra chased but the ground beneath him became suddenly uneven, slowing him down. The deer got away. Gra stared at it as it left. “Soon.”

Sui jumped across the river and stopped Gra. “That’s my deer friend. He’s a magic deer. Don’t kill him.”

Gra holstered his axe. “No promises.”

They got to the kobold cave and Gra looked at the map one more time. “It looks like this main path is blocked by boulders. We’ll have to take this side path.”

They entered the cave, weapons drawn. It was dark, but Gra could see just fine with his dark vision.

Sui, however, tripped over a stone.

“Are you ok?”

“Yeah, I’m fine.”

“You didn’t see that rock?”

“It’s dark in here.”

“That’s what your darkvision is for.”

“Oh, right.” Sui chuckled. “Let me turn that on real quick.”

Gra gave him a strange look.

Sui tripped over another rock. “I knew that was there.”

“You… you don’t have darkvision, do you?”

Sui sighed. “No.”

Gra sighed and pulled a torch out of his bag and lit it. “Here.” Gra handed Sui the lit torch.

“Thanks.” Sui took the lit torch in his mouth so he could two-hand his bow.

“Stay behind me, things could get ugly.”

They found the side path. It was hidden behind a 10ft blockade of rock. But the ceiling was 30ft high, so they easily climbed over it. They snuck down the narrow side path.

“Get back to work!” A flying kobold spoke in draconic as it whipped something from behind a rock.

“But we’re hungry!” Some kobolds in another room complained. “Can’t we just have some of that stew brewing on the campfire?”

“Such insubordination!” The flying kobold whipped again.

Gra’s stomache rumbled. He showed himself to the flying kobold.

The flying kobold flew up to the ceiling and shouted, “Intr—”

Sui shot it out of the air. It fell to the ground.

Audible kobold gasps came from the room to their right.

“Can’t have them swarming us.” Gra ran into the intersection. Peeling off a patch from his cloak, he tossed it at the ground in front of the whipped kobolds. A door sprang up out of the patch, blocking off the flightless kobolds from reaching Gra. A handle presented itself to Gra, but he didn’t open it. He signaled to Sui that it was clear.

“What’s this door here?” Sui asks.

“Don’t worry about it.”

They stalked down a narrow corridor to the main hub room, where a bunch of kobolds were sitting around a campfire. The smell of the stew wafted into Gra’s nostrils. “Ah, venison!” His stomache rumbled. “Soon.”

Suddenly, the ground trembled. Small tremors shook the cave. Gra and Sui clung up against a wall. It felt like they were coming from the cave entrance.

“What’s that trembling?” A kobold held the pot in the campfire.

“I’ll go check.” A kobold got up from the campfire and approached the hallway where Gra waited patiently.

Another tremor hit. The kobold holding the stew lost his balance and knocked the pot over, spilling venison stew everywhere.

Sui took the opportunity to shoot an arrow through him and another kobold, who was flying above, whipping the cook. Both fell to the ground, dead.

The kobolds all got out of their seat and looked around.

The kobold investigating the tremors tripped and stumbled right into Gra. He looked up at him, terrified. “In… in… Intruders!” Then this 3ft kobold stabbed Gra in the chest. But, instead of the dagger piercing Gra’s skin, the blade bent sideways, rendering the dagger useless.

Gra grinned. “You shouldn’t have done that.” He lifted up his battle axe with both hands and slammed it to the ground, cleaving the kobold right down the middle.

The kobolds all looked on in shock as they witnessed the brutal death of one of their kin.

The hulking half-orc stepped into the light, dragging his bloodied axe behind him. “Who’s next?”

“Get him!” Yelled a brave kobold. He rushed in, stabs Gra, bending his dagger. But his courage was infectious. The other kobolds grabbed their slings and hit Gra with everything they had. Stones flew across the room directly at Gra, hitting their mark.

The stones all bounced off Gra’s chest. One grazed his ear, cutting him. But no serious damage was done.

Gra yelled in rage, “Come at me!” The pelting stones didn’t slow him down. His eyes, filled with determination, stared at two kobolds standing on a bench. He approached them, axe dragging behind him, and he spoke in a steady, stern voice, “Follow or die!” He spoke in fluent draconic.

The two kobolds dropped their weapons and hugged each other. They nodded at Gra, necks shaking.

“Good.”

Sui shoots a few more kobolds, killing one with an arrow between the eyes.

Gra looks around the room, looking for the next big kobold group. Instead, he sees something unusual. A kobold twice the size of a regular kobold shuffles its lanky legs up the main corridor, into the main hub room, and dashes into the nearest hallway out of sight. “Weird.” He scans the room again.

A group of 3 kobolds huddled together on a bench. They shoot him with their slings. When he gets close, one shanks him with his dagger unsuccessfully. They gulp as he towers over them.

Sui follows Gra’s lead. “You better come with us if you want to live.”

The kobolds spit on him.

Gra yells at them, but the kobolds don’t cower.

“We’re not scared of you!” yells one kobold in draconic.

“Well, perhaps you’ll listen to logic then. If you don’t want to die, I’m your new leader. Got it?” Gra swung his axe onto his shoulder.

One kobold whispered to the other one, and then they both bowed to Gra. “We accept.”

“Good.” Gra was satisfied that he now had 4 kobold underlings. And he only had to kill seven kobolds to do it. “Not bad for a start.”

Out of the corner of his eye, Gra caught it again. The lanky tall kobold ran out of the side room and into another side room. According to the map, all the side rooms were dead ends.

Gra turned to Sui. “Have you ever seen a kobold that big before?”

Sui pointed. “If I had to guess, that’s my deer friend. He does that.”

Gra licked his lips. “Deeer…” He pushed a kobold forward, speaking in draconic, “Go into that room—”

“With that big kobold?” The kobold asked.

“Don’t interrupt me! Go into that room and keep that big kobold from getting out.”

“Yes, boss.” The kobold ran and stood in the entrance. He came face to face with the most unnaturally tall kobold he ever saw. It stared intently at him. He shook in place, but stood in the door nonetheless.

“We’re getting some venison today!” Gra picked up the pot and put it back on the campfire.

==========================================================

It was getting to be midday and Frill the kobold was getting hungry. He moved another rock to block the main entrance stairs. He took a rock from Sylla, and heard her stomache rumble.

“You’re hungry too?” he asked her.

Sylla nodded.

“I’ll get us something to eat.” Frill jumped down from the ledge he was on and walked down the hall to the main hub room, where a campfire was brewing venison stew.

The flying kobold stopped him. “Get back to work!” He whipped him.

“But we’re hungry!” Frill jumped back.

“Such insubordination!” The flying kobold whipped him again.

As Frill sat on the ground, he saw a shadow lurk up towards the flying kobold.

“Intr—” The flying kobold fell to the ground, an arrow in his chest.

Before Frill could react, the shadow turned into a giant orc and then a door appeared at his feet, blocking the path. Frill glanced at the door, but didn’t see a handle. He yelled to Sylla, “Run!”

Sylla and the other three kobolds didn’t see what happened and had just thought Frill had gotten whipped again.

Frill climbed up the wall and over the boulders that blocked the main entrance stairs. “There’s intruders! We gotta go!”

“Intruders? Then we gotta go kill them!” A scarred kobold said. He saw the door, and instantly knew there was only one way out.

“Let’s go!” Frill looked at the main hallway entrance on the other side of the rock blockade. There was a boulder on one side that wasn’t there before. “Odd…” He approached it.

“Frill! Help!” Sylla cried out. She was having a hard time climbing the rocks with the other 3 kobolds trying to push past her.

Frill reached out a hand to help her up.

“Thanks! Wait, that wasn’t there before.” Sylla approached the boulder.

The other 3 kobolds scrambled up the blockade.

Suddenly, the boulder turned into a deer!

“Deer!” Frill shouted excitedly.

“Food!” Sylla licked her lips.

The deer jumped away as Frill tried to grab it. A yellow spark flowed up its antlers and the ground shook. The deer ran down the main entrance toward the cave opening. Behind it, the ground moved. A pit as wide as the tunnel and as deep as a kobold’s height sank down into the ground, and behind a wall the same width and height grew out of the dirt.

The ground shook, knocking Frill and Sylla off their feet. The other 3 kobolds fell off the blockade and landed at the bottom of the stairs.

“Don’t worry, brothers!” Frill yelled. “I’ll get us that deer, and then I’ll save our other brothers from the intruders!” Frill charged forward, jumping over the pit and grabbing onto the edge of the wall. He climbed up with ease.

“Frill, wait!” Sylla cried out. She jumped down into the pit and then climbed up the wall. Slowly, but steadily.

Frill got to the top of the wall and saw the deer. He pulled out his sling and shot it.

But the deer dodged and jumped over the blockade into the side path. Its antlers sparked, and the ground shook. Another pit and wall combo formed in front of Frill.

“A magic deer, huh? I bet you’ll be even tastier!” Frill long-jumped from the top of the wall to the second wall. He grabbed onto the edge, skipping the second pit altogether. Then he jumped to the blockade blocking the side path.

The magic deer was just on the other side of it. Its antlers sparked again, and again the ground shook.

Frill braced for the tremors. The ground in front of the blockade went down, and the blockade that Frill stood on went up. It was now a 30ft drop from the top of the blockade to the bottom of the pit. But Frill didn’t have to land in the pit. He could land just beyond it, on the other side of the curve of the side path. It would be tricky, but he could do it. He jumped off the blockade and bounced off the wall, landing awkwardly on the other side of the pit. He made it, but he hurt all over. He tried to get up, but his arms wouldn’t move. Neither would his legs. “Help!” He squeaked out. He watched the deer escape down the side path deeper into the cave.

Sylla climbed down the first wall and climbed slowly but surely down the pit and up the next wall.

Two kobolds were lagging behind Sylla, trying to figure out how to climb the wall. But the third one, the scarred one, figured it out fast.

“No time to waste!” The scarred kobold raced past her, carelessly jumping over the walls with some agile movement. Sylla didn’t see, but the scarred kobold climbed the 20 feet up the side path blockade and jumped over the landing to the other side. “Ahhhhhh!” And then a *THUD!*

“I’m coming!” Sylla climbed the side path blockade and examined the situation. The scarred kobold was bleeding out its head at the bottom of the pit, and just beyond the curve of the side path, she could see a kobold tail twitch. “Frill!” She climbed down into the pit and up out of it. She ran to Frill’s side. “Are you ok?”

“Can’t… move…” Frill cried, taking big heavy breaths.

Sylla took him in her arms. “It’ll be ok, Frill. It’ll be ok.”

“I didn’t get the deer, Sylla. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t worry about it. You’re going to get better, ok?”

Frill whined. His neck went limp and his heavy breathing stopped.

Sylla hugged him tighter and cried.

# Chapter 5 – The Kobold Hierarchy

“What are you doing?” Sui asked Gra.

Gra got up from his pot. “Preparing a meal.”

“No, there’s more kobolds here.”

“Right, right.” Gra pointed to an unexplored side path. “I’ll go here.” He walked noisily into the side path, fe-fi-fo’ing his way into the room at the end. In draconic, he yelled, “Alright, you cowards!” He looked into the room.

A bunch of kobolds were shivering in a corner. A yinglet slept tied up against a wall.

“You either join me or die!”

The kobolds shivered.

“All with me, stand up and come here.” He pointed in front of him.

5 kobolds do as he says, but two stay cowered in the corner.

“C’mon, one kobold whispers. He’ll kill us all if you don’t listen!”

Another kobold took the hand of the 2 scared kobolds and dragged them into position.

Gra nodded. “Very good. Keep that one tied up for now.” He motioned to the yinglet. “I’ll be back.”

“We’ll be here.”

Gra came back to the main hub room. He found the sentinel kobold sitting around the campfire, instead of guarding the tunnel like he asked. “You! What are you doing?”

The kobold fell off his seat. “I… I…”

“Why aren’t you guarding that room?”

“It escaped! You said it was a deer in disguise, right? It ran off to the main entrance.”

“You let it escape?”

“It jumped over me!”

Gra gave him a disapproving glance.

“Gra, come here!” Sui whispered from the other side path. “There’s more kobolds in this room.”

“Wait here.” Gra told the kobold, before joining Sui. “Don’t worry, I got this.”

Gra stomped into the room and frightened the whole group of 7 kobolds.

Meanwhile, the lanky kobold Gra was trying to stop poked its head out of the fishing room and into the main hub. The sentinel kobold saw it, but was to scared to disobey Gra’s last order of “wait here.” The lanky kobold walked awkwardly across the main hub room and into the room where the yinglet was being held.

Inside, the 7 kobolds were all discussing amongst each other what to do.

“We wait here, just like he said.”

“But what if he’s planning on rounding us all up and killing us?”

“If he wanted to kill us, he would’ve done so by now.”

“Yeah, he’s probably going to become our new boss.”

“Maybe he’ll be kinder than our current boss?”

“Probably not.”

Then the lanky kobold appeared in the doorway. The kobolds all gave him funny looks.

“Who are you?”

But before they could approach, things went flying across the room. Blankets and bedrolls flittered in the air, pillows hit them in the face, and barrels rolled around.

“Mm? Mmm?” The sleeping, gagged yinglet woke up for a brief moment before fading back into slumber.

The kobolds got on the ground and put their hands over their heads.

Things settled down when a bunch of bananas rose out of some bed sheets, hung in the middle of the room, and then dropped onto one of the kobolds.

“I thought I said no food in bed?” A kobold scolded.

“I get snacky at night.”

In the midst of the chaos, the ropes around the yinglet were loosened. But the yinglet didn’t move, except for its stomach while breathing.

Then the lanky kobold left, and the dust settled.

“What was that?”

“Definitely not a kobold.”

Back in the other room, Gra told his new kobold recruits to await further instructions. “And if you see a lanky kobold, let me know immediately.”

“Yes, sir.”

Sui came in after Gra and yelled at them. “You all better stay in line!”

“Is that the lanky kobold?” A kobold whispered to another.

“Stupid kobolds!” Sui yelled. “I’m a dragonborn. Clearly! You better behave or you’ll die by Gra’s hand!”

The kobolds cowered and let Sui pass.

In the next room, Gra frightened two kobolds, but the last kobold, who could fly, stood his ground.

“You’re not budging, are you?”

“No! I will not join you! You are a murderer!”

“Prove your loyalty.” Gra placed a hand on each of his two new recruits from that room. “Convince your mate.”

The two kobolds pleaded with the flying kobold to relent. He didn’t. They offered him bananas, copper coins, a washrag, but nothing worked. Finally they promised not to complain about his orders ever again. He gave in, but with some conditions. “I want my own section of kobolds. A *whole* section.”

“Done. Will these two work?”

“Yes. But I require a few more.”

“Ok, we’ll work out the details later. Right now, hang tight.”

Gra heard whispering, but didn’t see another room.

The kobolds fidgeted.

“But, to prove *your* loyalty, you’re going to tell me where your other kobold friends are hiding.” Gra held his axe up to the flying kobold.

The flying kobold reluctantly flew up to a perch 10ft off the ground. Behind it, was another tunnel leading to another room.

“You’ve done well. I’ll make sure you get your section.” Gra climbed up the wall and roared.

Behind him, Sui was waiting with a bow and arrow, and more choice words ready for the flying kobold leader. But before he could enter, a deer fell onto the ground in front of him and turned around. It pointed at the passage to the main hub room.

“Deer!” Sui shouted. “Why are you here? Can you please not interfere!”

The deer looked shocked. He continued pointing, ears down.

“Get out of our business.” Sui pushed past the deer, but his hand went through the deer. “Stupid deer.” Sui arrived in the room with the flying kobold and his two underlings. “You guys better not screw anything up!”

The lanky kobold ran across the main hub, following the sound of Sui’s shouting. It tripped once, but got back up and entered the next room.

The kobolds there stared at it questionably. “That is one strange kobold.”

“Is it the lanky kobold?”

“I don’t know, it just could be a short dragonborn.”

“Well, should we ask?”

“You ask it.”

One kobold got pushed forward to ask the lanky kobold what it was. “Are you a dragonborn or a kobold?”

The lanky kobold looked down and stared blankly. Then the room flew into chaos. Rocks darted around the room, blankets popped up and floated down, and barrel corks shot out. The kobolds all cowered in fear.

“It’s not a kobold! It’s not a kobold!”

A book appeared out from under a pillow. It gently lifted itself into the air, making a journey somewhere else.

“My bedtime stories!” The kobold closest to the book grabbed it and held it close. It stopped moving on its own.

“What’s all that racket?” Sui yelled from the other room.

The lanky kobold hid behind a barrel, and the spectral deer stood in front of him.

Sui looked around the room. “Did you do this, deer? You better not be harming any of our kobolds!” Sui turned to the kobolds. “Did this deer hurt you?”

The kobolds gulped. “N-no…”

“I swear, deer.” Sui marched on. “I’ll deal with you later, right now I have more important matters to tend to.” Sui left to go the main hub room.

The lanky kobold moved on to the room with the flying kobold leader, and tore that room apart to. From behind the wall, Gra could be heard talking to the last group.

In that room, there were a bunch of barrels, and more kobolds. One taller kobold with green scales huddled close with his most loyal subjects. Once Gra stepped into the room, the other kobolds cowered behind him.

“Who… who are you?” The kobold chieftain stood up to Gra.

“I’m the guy who just took over your entire settlement. So are you going to join the ones standing with me or the ones lying on the floor?” Gra points his axe at the kobold chieftain.

The kobold chieftain flinches.

“I’m taking over entirely. What I say goes. But I’ll need delegates, so you’ll still have authority, somewhat. What say you?”

The kobold chieftain nods. “Ok. Just don’t hurt my subjects.”

“Alright, now that that’s settled, follow me to the campfire. We’re going to have a meeting.”

The kobolds followed him.

The lanky kobold panicked when he heard Gra approaching from the other side of the wall. It hid behind a treasure chest.

Gra climbed over the wall and noticed that the room was a mess. “What happened here?”

The flying kobold pointed to the corner.

Gra saw the cowering lanky kobold and grabbed at it. It dodged, and jumped away, but hit its leg on the treasure chest. Gra grabbed its leg and pulled it in. “I don’t know what you are, but you’re not getting away.” He held it under his arm. It looked really weird. Although Gra was holding on tight, it looked like he wasn’t touching it at all. He carried the lanky kobold to the main hub room, with the other kobolds behind him.

============================================

“Frill! Friiill!” Sylla cried, holding him in her arms.

“Sylla, what happened?” Another kobold appeared at the top of the wall. It approached.

“Stop!” Sylla yelled.

The kobold came closer, getting to the edge of the wall.

“Don’t! It’s too deep!”

The kobold looked confused. “What?” It shrugged, and hopped down. “Aaaahhhhh!”

Sylla gasped. She shut her eyes, so she wouldn’t see what happened to her friend. Blood splattered onto her face, including her eye lids. A scurrying sound came from the other side. It was the last kobold in their section.

“Go away!” Sylla yelled. “Run! Don’t climb! Run away!”

The kobold stopped climbing and ran away, out of the cave.

“At least I saved one of my friends.” She wiped away a tear. “But this will not stand. I’m going to get that deer!”

She marched down the side path, past the iron door, and into the main hub room, where five kobolds sat around an empty pot. “What’s going on?” She tiptoed around the dead kobolds.

“We all work for Gal now.”

“No, it’s Growl.”

“I heard Bra.”

“Who?” Sylla asked.

“This big green ogre—”

“Orc.”

“Whatever. This big green orc who came in, sliced a kobold in half, and scared us.”

“You mean he’s still here?” Sylla’s brows furrowed.

“Yeah, and he’s super scary. You don’t want to mess with him.”

“How can you call yourself a kobold?” Sylla scolded. “We live and die to become dragons! Do you think some orc cares about that? No! He’s going to have us digging tunnels and gathering food while he puts his feet up and takes a nap!”

The other kobolds winced. They hung their heads in shame.

“We have to stop them. We have to get our fellow kobolds back on our side, and take care of these intruders!”

“You’re right, Sylla. We should’ve been braver.”

The other five kobolds stood up, ready to fight. “Now what?”

“Let’s go gather our friends.”

Suddenly, a dragonborn appeared from a side room. “Are you planning what I think you’re planning? You better get back in line before Gra finds out!”

The five kobolds cowered behind the stone seats around the campfire.

“On second thought, we can’t become dragons if we’re dead.”

“Please, Sylla, understand!” A kobold got on his knees. “We can’t beat this guy. Our weapons do nothing.”

Sylla sighed, and shelved her fire. “Ok. I’ll join you guys.”

The kobolds sighed. “We’re going to live!”

“We’re going to survive.” Sylla whispered to herself, holding a special rock that Frill had given her.

===================================================

Gra marched up behind Sui, holding the lanky kobold. “Everything ok?”

“Yeah, just keeping the kobolds in line.” Sui saw the lanky kobold. “Is that you, deer?”

“If it is, it’s going to make a good meal.”

Sui sighed. “Don’t eat him. He’s a magic deer.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah. It wouldn’t be good food.”

“Hmm. Ok. I won’t eat this deer.” Gra assured.

The lanky kobold flickered and turned into a deer.

“I knew it was you.” Sui exclaimed.

Gra stomped to the middle of the room, and the kobolds there looked at him expectantly, their mouths drooling. “No, we’re not eating this deer.”

They looked away.

Gra turned to the kobold chieftain. “Gather your kobolds, we’ll have the meeting here.”

The kobold chieftain did as told.

The kobolds guarding the yinglet brought him with them, tied up with a single rope around the arms and waist, and held onto it with the rest of the rope, like a leash.

Gra started the meeting once all the kobolds were there. He stood ontop a seat to increase his height advantage. The deer was still tightly held under his arms, which helped grab the kobolds’ attention. “I have an announcement. I am your leader now. You will do as I say and exactly as I say it. I will not tolerate insubordination or disrespect towards me,” he motioned to himself and Sui, “or my colleague dragonborn here.”

The kobolds licked their lips. One started setting the pot on the campfire, another went to fetch water.

Gra shut it down. “And there will be no eating this deer. Understood?”

The kobolds hung their heads, except for Sylla, who stared angrily at the deer.

“You will be reprimanded if you even touch a hair on this deer’s back.”

Sylla didn’t drop her gaze.

“Hey, Sui. Go talk to that kobold.” Gra whispered, pointing Sylla out.

“Sure.” Sui stepped through the kobold crowd and grabbed Sylla’s wrist. “Come with me.”

Sui led Sylla to the fishing room. “What’s your name?”

“Sylla.”

He could tell she was different. She was covered in dirt and blood, and her facial expression hid a rage that made her fearless. “What happened to *you*?”

“A gauntlet of pits, walls, traps, and despair. I lost two of my close friends, and my single, very best friend. *That’s* what happened.”

“You don’t have to be so rude.”

Sylla looked away. “After Growl killed our section leader, and put up that iron door, my section ran the other way around.”

Sui nodded. “Yeah, *Gra* blocked your path so you chased us the long way around.”

“And along the way,” Sylla’s fist balled, “we ran into that deer. That very same deer that Gra is holding.”

“And?”

“And I want to rip its antlers off, chop them in half, and stab it with its own antlers.”

“But why?”

“It killed my friends!”

“But how?”

“I don’t know how it did it, but it shook the ground, and made pits to trap us, and walls to discourage us. And it made a really big wall and really deep pit. My best friend fell to his death, chasing that deer.”

“There’s no pits in the entrance.”

“I know! The deer made them appear.”

“Show me.”

Sylla started off, but Sui grabbed her again.

“But just in case, I’m going to tie this rope around you, so you don’t escape.”

“Seriously? I live here. Where do you think I’m going to go?”

“Mmm. Ok.” Sui dropped it.

Sylla led Sui to the place where Frill died. The pits were gone, but there were three dead kobolds, like she said. Two of them had went splat and had their heads cracked open.

“Well, I don’t see the pits.”

“But the bodies are still here!” Sylla pointed. “The evidence is right here!”

“Yeah, and we can’t have bodies blocking our entrance. They’re going to have to be moved, pronto.”

“You’re not the boss of me.”

“Did you hear what Gra said? Insubordination will NOT be tolerated.”

Sylla eyed him. “Ok.”

“Now move these bodies.”

“Where to?”

“Anywhere, just so they’re not blocking this path.”

Sylla picked up one of her friend’s arms, but the body didn’t move.

Sui sighed. “You’re not strong enough, are you?”

“No.”

Sui picked up the three dead kobold bodies with ease. Frill’s lifeless arms flung over his shoulder, tapping the heads of the other two kobolds. His eyes stared directly into Sylla’s, dead and lifeless. Sui carried the three bodies out of the cave and dropped them unceremoniously on the ground.

“You can’t just dump the bodies like that!”

“Why not?”

“They need a proper burial!”

“What for? They’re just kobolds.”

Sylla stewed. She started digging.

But Sui stopped her. “Come on, we’re going back to the meeting.” He dragged her back to the campfire in the cave.

“And we will be expanding this cave system.” Gra was still giving his speech. “Plans will be drawn soon, and you will follow the plans. If you have questions, do not be scared to ask me.”

The deer turned into Sui. “What the deck man! Put me down!”

Gra raised an eyebrow at the Sui in his arms.

“That stupid deer switched me out! It’s getting away! Put me down so I can go after it!”

“Very clever, deer.” Gra squeezed hard, making the deer drop his disguise. “But you’re not very good at copying Sui’s voice. He’s more skiddish.” He looked back at the kobolds gathered around.

Sui returned with Sylla. He seemed to have some news.

“And that is all for now. Go to your quarters and have a good rest.”

The kobolds scattered, pouring out into the side tunnels. As they left, a book floated out of one of the kobold’s hands. It floated over and into the deer’s fur. The deer smiled.

Gra got off his podium and approached Sui. “What’s up with her?”

Sui pulled Sylla forward. “Her friends died chasing that deer. Something about a pit.”

“A pit? There’s no pits there.”

“Do you remember those tremors we felt? That was probably the pits forming.”

“And you think this deer did that?”

“Well,” Sui stared into the deer’s face. “I’ve never seen it do that before, but it’s possible. Some spell like Mold Earth or something.”

“Well, deer?” Gra squeezed gently.

The deer hung its head in defeat. A spark flowed up its antler. The ground shook, and Gra braced himself. The column of dirt Gra stood on rose 10ft into the air. Under Sui, the ground dropped 10ft, putting him in a pit.

“So it was you. Wow, that’s… useful.” Gra smiled. “You can put me down now.”

The ground shifted back to normal, shaking the ground as it went.

“What’s your name, deer?”

The deer shrugged.

“Come on, I know you have a name.”

“BLEAT!”

“In a language I can understand.”

The deer didn’t say anything.

“Stop being difficult! Tell him your name!” Sui yelled.

“Hey don’t scream at it!” Gra shut him down. “Come on deer, I know you can talk.”

The deer hung its head. A spark flitted up its antler, and letters appeared on the ground in front of Gra.

ASTALIR

“Alistar? Like that one guy?”

Astalir shook his head.

“Oh, it’s switched. Asteer… Astaril… As-ta-leer. Astalir?”

The deer nodded.

“So, Astalir…” Gra sat on a bench next to the campfire. “What do you do?”

SURVIVE

“Hmm… interesting. We’ll have to talk about that later.” Gra put a log on the campfire. “But I meant, what do you *do*? Like, as a job.”

“I think he’s a wizard or something.”

“Sui, can you go get the prisoner?”

“What?”

“The yinglet. In that room over there.”

“Hmm. Ok.” Sui left to fetch the yinglet prisoner.

“So, you were saying?” Gra took a sip from his waterskin, still holding Astalir tight under his arm.

INFO ACQUISTION

“Info acquisition? So, like a spy?” Gra held his waterskin up to Astalir’s mouth.

Astalir shook his head no.

“Well, then I’m afraid I don’t quite understand.”

Sui returned with the yinglet, standing him in front of Gra.

Gra turned him around and untied him. “Who are you?”

“This one is called Gale, Gale Wind, of the desert.” The yinglet spoke with a timid voice.

Gra pat the seat next to him, opposite Astalir. “Sit down.”

Gale sat next to Gra.

“So Gale, why do you speak of yourself in the third person?”

“This one has always done it, since birth.”

“What happened to you? How did you end up here?”

“This one woke up here. This one was camping in woods, when kobold scum knocked this one out.”

“I’m Gra, now the leader of these kobolds. Sorry to hear that my new recruits did this to you. I’ll have a talk with them.”

“This one was wondering what was going on. This one thanks you.”

Astalir turns into the yinglet.

“What’s that one?”

“Don’t worry about him.” Gra pets Astalir on the head through his disguise. Astalir turns back into a deer.

Sui shuffles a deck of cards. He holds it out to Gra. “Want to draw one?”

“What is this?”

“Deck of random oddities. I got some random buffs from it already.”

“I could use some buffs.” Gra drew a card. His eyes popped wide open, and his grogginess faded. “Wow, I feel wired!”

“Oh yeah I got that card too. I haven’t slept in days!”

“That’s good news. Not sleeping will make things easier to keep.” He gave Astalir a squeeze.

Astalir looked dismayed. His brows furrowed and his ears pinned back. He kicked the air with his hind leg.

“Now don’t try to escape. I’ll let you go when I know I can trust you.”

“How about you?” Sui held the deck out to Astalir.

A card floated off the top of the deck and to Astalir. He looked at it. He didn’t feel any different, and nothing seemed to change.

“What that one do? This one not see.”

“I don’t know, but do you want to draw a card?” Sui held the deck out to Gale.

“This one will give it a try.” Gale drew a card. His pupils dilated to fill his whole eye socket. He got down on the ground and wagged his kangaroo-like yinglet tail. His ears flopped. “Bark! Bark!” He put his forepaws on Gra’s lap and panted.

Gra let out a big laugh. He ruffled Gale’s head a little. “Who’s a good doggy? Who’s a good doggy!”

“He got the dog card! He’s acting like a dog!” Sui pointed.

“Another mastiff for my collection.” Gra commented. He picked up a stick and threw it.

Gale ran awkwardly on his short forelimbs and long, kangaroo-like yinglet legs. His body wasn’t made for quadrupedal movement, but he made do. He grabbed the stick in his mouth and returned it to Gra.

“This is hilarious!”

A minute or two later, Gale’s eyes go back to normal. He looks down at the stick in his mouth and the floor he’s all fours on. “Bleh!” He spits out the stick, stands up, and dusts himself off.

“Do you want to draw again?” Sui stifled a laugh.

“Blasted cards!” Gale pushed the deck away. “This one will not be doing that again!”

“Shit man, that was probably the hardest I’ve laughed in years! Here, for your troubles.” Gra reached into his bag with his single free hand and pulled out four gold pieces, handing it to Gale.

“This one did not enjoy this, but is glad you enjoyed it.”

Gra gave him a hearty slap on the back.

Astalir’s antler sparked. His pupils grew to fill his eye, his ears flopped to the side of his head, and his tail wagged enthusiastically. “Bark! Bark!”

“You too, Astalir?” Gra turned to Sui. “They both got the same card?”

“Ha! That one’s dog-minded!” Gale pointed and laughed.

“No…” Sui examined the deck. “There’s only one card of each type.”

The stick floated up to Gra’s free hand. “Bark! Bark!” Astalir’s tail wagged and his tongue hung out.

Gra stared intently into Astalir’s eyes, and eventually saw through the illusion. “Nice try, Astalir.”

Astalir hung his head, and he returned to normal.

“You really are a clever deer, though.”

After an hour or so, Gale fell asleep. While Gra and Sui talked, Astalir pulled out the book he found in the kobold’s room. It was a diary written in Aarakocra, a language the kobolds most definitely couldn’t read. It told the daily struggles of an Aarakocra living in the mountains. Astalir read through it, completely engrossed.

Gra laid down next to the campfire, and Sui did too. Gra held onto Astalir, not letting him get away.

“So what’s your plan for this cave?” Sui asked.

“Well it’s going to be our new base of operations.”

“So you’re staying in town?”

“It looks like it. I don’t have any home to go to. This one will do.”

“How are you going to manage all these kobolds?”

“That’s what I have you for. And we’re going to designate some kobolds to be leaders.”

Astalir shifted to get comfy despite Gra’s arms and closed his eyes, as if to go to sleep.

“Which ones?” Sui hugged an arrow close to his chest.

“Obviously, the green scaled one. He’s going to be directly below me, after you. The winged kobolds make natural leaders, and one in particular is good at inspiring others.”

“Speaking of inspiring, I have a suggestion.”

“Yes?” Gra asked.

“That blue-hooded one, Sylla. She is very inspirational. The kobolds follow her.”

“Yes, I was thinking of her as well. We will have to give her her own “section”, as they call it.”

“Yes.”

Gra and Sui didn’t fall asleep. Astalir tried to stay awake, but fell asleep after a few hours of getting comfy. He didn’t know what Gra was going to do with him, but he knew he needed to come up with an escape plan. Tomorrow. He will sleep on it and do something tomorrow.

Astalir fell asleep, laying his head on the cave floor.

================================================

An hour or so later, when everyone else was asleep, Gra got up, carrying Astalir with him, and walked to the cave entrance. They both looked up at the moonlit sky. Stroking his head, Gra gently asked Astalir, “Survivor?”

Astalir cocked his head.

“You said that what you do is survive. What did you mean by that?”

Astalir looked away. He hung his head in sorrow. Then, a single spark made its way from the base of his antlers all the way to the furthest most tip.

Illuminated by the moonlight, cave drawings appeared on the cave wall. A god arose, holding its hand closed. A brilliant light radiated from within his hand, and when he opened them, several deers stood there in his palm. The deers descended to earth, running around living their best lives. Flowers, bushes, trees sprang up around them, becoming a forest. Then the god became cross, and rained lightning on the deers. One by one, the deers fell, and the ones that remained fled.

Gra’s countenance fell. Astalir refused to look, but his face was contorted, eyes closed, brows furrowed.

The deers that survived ran to a different forest. Humans came, bows at the ready, and hunted the deers down. Of the original deers, only 4 remained. They all ran away, but in separate directions, running off the edge of the cave wall. Finally, one deer remained. That deer shifted into an old man, into a commoner, into a goblin, into a kobold. That deer came across a yellow dragonborn and a pale green orc, and followed them into a cave.

“I see.” Gra nodded. “Gods have done me no favors either.”

A single tear dropped from Astalir’s eye.

Gra set Astalir on the ground, but held a hand on him. “I see now why you distrust people. But I don’t think your avoidance is justified.”

Astalir cocked his head.

“You’re safe here, with us. If you want to stay, that is. None of us here have any plans of harming you.”

Astalir looked defiantly into Gra’s eyes.

“If I let you go, will you try to trust us and rely on us, at least a little?”

Astalir lowered his eyebrows.

Gra shrugged. “Ok. I get it. But at least check in once in a while, just so I know you’re alive?”

Astalir gave a single nod.

Gra took his hand off Astalir.

Astalir looked around, and up and down Gra. Then he ran away, but didn’t. A deer ran off into the night, and a deer stood there in front of Gra.

“You’re not real, are you?” He asked the deer in front of him.

The deer shook its head, accidentally passing an antler through a wall.

“Can you see through this thing? Is it like a familiar?”

The deer shook its head again. It stomped its front hoof. Below it, a shiny object glimmered in the moonlight.

“What do we have here?” Gra picked it up, receiving a static-shock from it. It was a steel falcata, with the initials “MG” expertly carved into the blade. “Is this for me?”

The deer nodded, then disappeared.

“Thank you, Astalir.” Gra whispered into the night.

# Chapter 6 – The Aarakocra Map

Over the next week, Gra started several projects in the kobold cave: food supply, entrance maintenance, and education. He hunted deer (non-magical), rabbits, and fish to feed the kobolds. He organized a project to restore the main entrance. He taught the kobolds about how to live among humans without causing problems. Sui helped oversee all these projects.

One night Gra was out hunting. He shot an arrow at a deer, which landed in its back. And then he chased it. It ran all the way to the stream before he managed to grapple it. He pushed it down into the stream and held its shoulder to the flat rocks below. Blood trickled out of the deer’s arrow wound into the water. With his free hand, he headlocked the deer’s neck, despite its protests. Two well-placed fingers held the deer’s eye open and stationary. Gra stared into them.

“Hmm… you don’t look magical to me.”

He then carried the deer out of the water and laid it on dry land, where he stepped on its shoulder to get a clean slice to the head. “I’m sorry.” The deer’s cries of pain instantly stopped. “Please rest in peace.” He picked up the deer carcass and walked back with it.

Along the way back to the cave, he ran into Sui. “Everything ok?” Gra asked.

Sui grumbled. “The kobolds peed in the river again. I’m going to go get sanitary drinking water.”

Gra sighed. “We’re going to have to teach them better hygiene.”

“I’m trying, but they don’t listen to me.”

“I know. But hey, I got something special today. Some fresh venison and some spices I got from town.” Gra enthusiastically opened his bag of holding to him.

“That sounds delicious.”

“Yeah I’m going to put it in the pot when I get back to the cave.”

“Just please, don’t use the water from the cave river.”

“Oh right. Would you mind fetching us some clean water?”

“For some venison stew? Alright.” Sui walked off to the stream.

As Gra walked back to the cave, he looked up at the moon lighting the night sky, the same moon that Astalir used to illuminate his cave drawings. Where was he now? Hopefully, wherever he was, he was doing alright.

Gra got close to the cave, and found something peculiar: Sui walking into the cave. “Huh? How did he get back faster than me? Hey Sui!” He yelled, but he was apparently too far from the entrance for Sui to hear.

Sui disappeared into the cave. He didn’t seem to be holding any water containers or anything.

“Have I been staring at the moon for that long?” Gra walked briskly into the cave, passing the side path, and going straight for the metal door he “installed” the first time he entered. He knocked.

“What’s the password?”

“Gra is boss.”

“Oh! It’s you boss!” The smooth metal door opened. Behind it stood a small kobold, standing at command.

“At ease.” Gra walked through. “Tell me, when you opened the door for Sui, did he have water on him?”

“No, boss.” The kobold closed the door. “Sui walked in silently from the side entrance.”

“Ok, I’ll have a word with him. Thank you.”

“You got it, boss.”

Gra carried the deer carcass to the campfire. As he set it down, the kobolds squealed in joy, tugging and tearing at it. Gra shooed them away. “This is for dinner tonight. No touching until the stew is done.”

The kobolds all pulled their hands back.

“Sylla?” Gra turned to a blue-hooded kobold.

“Yes, …boss?” Sylla sat on a bench.

“Keep them in line while I go talk to Sui.”

Sylla nodded. “You heard him! Claws off!”

“Did you see where Sui went?”

“He went that way.”

“Thank you, Sylla.”

Gra walked down the north tunnel that led to three different side rooms, the last one being the treasure room. When he heard the sound of coins clinging wildly, he stopped and moved along stealthily. He climbed the wall and into the tunnel that led to the treasure room and found something odd.

Sui was standing by himself in the treasure room, looking around as coins flew all around him. Coins popped off the ground and into the air, darting left and right, filling the air with a crazy amount of projectiles. Sui stood calm and still in the center, watching as if it was normal.

“Sui?” Gra entered the room.

Sui turned to Gra, a look of panic on his face.

Gra stopped moving. He cocked his head, squinting at Sui. As Sui froze, it became clear: Sui faded into a ghost, and underneath him was a walking deer. “Astalir?”

Astalir dropped the disguise and reared up on his hind legs, swinging his hooves wildly.

“Hey, hey.” Gra waved his arms down. “I just want to talk. I’m not going to grapple you. See?” Gra put his hands behind his back and leaned up against a wall.

Astalir flicked an ear and looked at Gra from the side.

“First of all, it’s good to see you. How’ve you been?”

Astalir made munching motions with his mouth.

“Hungry? How about these?” Gra pulled out some berries and presented them in his palm.

Astalir raised an eyebrow. The berries floated up to him, and one by one he inspected them. Then they floated into random positions around him, and he picked them out of the air with his tongue. As he swallowed, he smiled. His tail wagged.

“Ah, you like those.” Gra’s belt started moving on its own. A bag untied itself from his belt and was floating away. Gra reached out and grabbed it. “Uh-uh. If you want more you have to answer some questions first.”

Astalir huffed, but then waved his nose, looking directly at Gra.

“What are you doing here?”

A flicker of an antler, and a word on the ground.

Astalir got closer, letting his sniffing nose lead the way.

“Not yet.” Gra held the bag close. “What are you doing making a mess in our treasure room?”

Astalir rolled his face dramatically.

SECRETS

“You won’t tell me?”

SECRETS!!

“Oh… you’re *looking* for secrets!”

Astalir nodded.

“Well, I’ve been here for a week, and I haven’t found any secrets yet. So I think you can stop searching.”

OBLIVIOUS

Gra laughed. “Ok, if you think you can do better, have at it.”

Astalir nodded. The room flew into a frenzy again, coins flying everywhere.

Gra held up an arm to block coins from flying into his face.

Finally, after several minutes, the coins settled.

“So?”

EMPTY

“See? Are you ready to come out now?”

Astalir’s antler sparked as he got on two legs, transforming back into Sui.

“I’m going to choose to not see through that this time.” Gra commented to himself. “Ok, Sui, you ready to go?”

“Sui” nodded.

Gra led Sui to a side room, where he told him to wait. He walked into the main hub room, where some kobolds were preparing dinner.

“Do you think the dragonborn has firebreath?” A kobold asked as he stirred the pot.

“If he did, it’s awfully strange that he never volunteers to light the campfire.”

“Well, maybe he’s got other dragon gifts. Like magic?”

“Yeah but he only knows the spell, ‘Raise Voice’,” a kobold scoffed.

“I haven’t seen him cast magic, but I believe he can.”

“I doubt he does. But why do you believe?”

“One day, before we become dragons, we’ll become dragonborns. And when we do, we’ll have some semblance of the power of our elder brethren.”

Another kobold sighed in happiness. “That’ll be the day.”

Gra entered the room. “Have you seen Sui?”

Sylla pointed. “He’s in the fishing room cleaning the pot.”

“Thanks.” Gra peeked in and checked real quick. Sui was indeed in there cleaning the pot. Gra motioned to other Sui to come out.

The kobolds stared as they watched the dragonborn come from the north tunnel and go into the entrance tunnel, scowling at Gra when he passed the deer carcass. They cocked their heads so they could watch him leave through the metal door. Then they all scurried into the fishing room, where they found Sui still cleaning the pot.

“But… he was leaving… how did he get over there?”

“He *is* magic! He *is* magic! Dragonborns are higher beings!” The kobolds ran around cheering and hugging each other.

Even Sylla smiled. “I guess there is hope afterall.”

Outside the cave, Gra and Sui walked into the moonlit field. The gentle breeze blowed cool night air across their hair.

“Thanks for stopping by, Astalir. I hope to see you again soon.”

Sui transformed back into Astalir. “Bleat.”

“It’s your voice! It’s good to hear your voice!”

“BLEAT!” Astalir wagged his tail.

Gra smiled and laughed. He loosened his grip on the bag.

The bag of berries dislodged itself from Gra’s grasp and gravitated toward Astalir. “Bleat!” He smiled.

“You’re welcome. Enjoy!”

“Bleeeat!” Astalir ran off, pocketing the berry bag.

“Goodnight!”

Over the course of the next few weeks, Gra made significant progress on the kobold cave. The main entrance was easily accessible, the side path was blocked off, the kobolds had plenty of food, the kobolds practiced better hygiene, and they were starting to make tradable goods. Gra was quite pleased.

Every night, Gra stood outside the cave entrance, waiting for a deer call. When Astalir came, Gra gave him some berries. Astalir usually took the berries and ran off, bleating happily away. As the weeks went on, Astalir went from running off with the berries, to eating the berries in front of Gra, to eating them straight out of his hand. His sniffing nose tickled Gra’s hand. And after a while, Astalir even let Gra stroke his head fur while he ate the berries. Every night Gra would feed him berries, and every night Astalir would grow a little closer to him, and then bleat off into the woods.

One night, about 5 weeks after Astalir first snuck into the treasure room, Gra stood outside the cave entrance like usual. But this night, Astalir was a little late.

Gra decided to call for Astalir. “BLeAt!” He gasped. “bLeeEEaaaT.” He didn’t quite get the sound right.

“What’s going on out there?” Sui yelled from inside.

“Just practicing my deer call.” Gra yelled back. “Everything’s ok.”

“Ok, goodnight.”

“BLEEEEEaat!” Gra tried. He failed miserably.

A light chuckle came from the edge of the forest.

“Huh?” Gra investigated. A small tree shook uncontrollably. He poked it.

The tree toppled over onto the ground, chuckling all the way. On the ground, it turned into none other than Gra’s favorite magical deer.

“Astalir!”

“BLEEEaaT! BLeeeeAAAAttt!” Astalir mocked, rolling around on the ground.

Gra chuckled. “It’s good to see you too.”

“Bleat! Bleat!” Astalir stood up on all fours.

Gra patted his head. “How you doing buddy?”

“Bleat! Bleat!” Astalir pointed his nose up, ears perked, tail wagging.

“I got your favorite.” Gra opened the bag of holding, pulling out a pile of blueberries.

Astalir pulled his nose back in shock, furrowing his brow.

“What’s wrong?”

Astalir sniffed into Gra’s bag of holding. He pulled out a chunk of deer carcass.

“Oh. Sorry, I forgot to wrap that. The smell bothers you, doesn’t it?”

Astalir stared at him, side-eying.

“Hmm, you probably don’t like me eating deer meet, huh? I’m sorry, Astalir, but I have to feed my kobolds. But don’t worry, I only eat non-magical deer. And I only hunt for survival.”

Astalir stared for a second, then relaxed his expression. He licked Gra’s hand, and then presented his forehead, shoving the deer carcass back into the bag of holding.

“I’m glad you’re not mad at me.” Gra petted his head.

Astalir ate the berries from Gra’s hand, then licked his hand clean of berry juice. “Bleat.”

“Glad you liked it! What have you been up to lately?”

“Bleat.” A book appeared in front of Astalir, opening itself. Astalir scanned the pages as they flipped past, and then the book closed and disappeared.

“You’ve been reading? About what?”

A winged bird humanoid appeared, flying through the air. When it landed, Astalir pointed a hoof at it.

“Some kind of bird humanoid?”

A map floated out of Astalir’s fur and into Gra’s hands. It was hand drawn in ink on parchment; a painstakingly-drawn, yet incomplete, rendering of the surrounding area and a route to a mountain range. A thin, dotted line led to an X at a point called “Wind’s Crossing”. The X lit up on the page.

Gra nodded. “This is where the bird people are going?”

Astalir shook his head. He pointed a hoof to Gra, and then to himself, and then to a silent image of a mountain.

“Us? *We’re* going there?”

Astalir nodded.

“So you’re asking for my help?”

Astalir nodded.

Gra grunted, squinting at the map. “Astalir, this is a long journey, by the looks of it. We’re still working on the kobold cave. We can’t just leave.”

Astalir stared into his eyes. “Bleat?” He faced down but looked up.

“It’s important, huh?”

“Bleat.” Astalir nodded.

“Ok. I’ll make some arrangements. When do we leave?”

“Bleat-bleat.” Astalir reared up and did a 180. Gra’s hand pulled him forward.

“Now?” Gra stood his ground. “Hold on Astalir, let me go make some preparations.”

“Bleat.” The map floated up to Gra’s face, and a dot labeled “The Fiery Inn” glowed. “Bleeat.”

“Meet you at the tavern?”

“Bleat bleat.” Astalir nodded.

“Ok, I’ll meet you there within the next two hours, ok?”

“Bleat bleat.” Astalir jumped away. “Bleeeeaat!”

“See you soon!” Gra waved.

A drop hit his hand.

“Looks like rain.”

Gra gathered some supplies for the trip, and let the kobolds know that they would be going on a long trip. He put the kobold chieftain in charge, with Sylla as second-in-command. Sui and Gale accompanied him when he left for the tavern.

It was pouring rain and lightning as Gra, Sui, and Gale trekked through the night.

“Can’t this wait until morning?” Sui complained, running behind Gra.

“No.” Gra ran in front, leading the way.

“Why not?”

“I don’t know.”

“Well I don’t see why we’re going on this mission in the first place.”

A lightning flash revealed a stream coming up ahead.

“Just trust me.” Gra grabbed Gale and jumped clear over the stream, landing in the mud on the other side. He set Gale down gently.

“This one wishes we wait for after storm passed.”

“Me too.” Sui agrees, landing next to Gra.

A lightning flash, a rumbling, and a roar.

Gra puts an arm out, holding the party back. “Wait here.”

Sui readied his bow and arrow, and Gale drew his scimitar. They scanned the environment.

Gra approached a bush. He swiped a hand across it, but nothing was in it. “I swear I heard something.”

*SNAP! ROOOOAARR!*

An owlbear charged out from behind a tree at Sui! It bit into his side with its beak, and slashed at his shoulder with its claws, leaving a deep gash. It stepped forward, pushing Sui to the ground. It raised a claw to hit him again.

Gra bumrushed the owlbear, knocking it off balance, and off Sui. He pulled his battleaxe off his back and slashed its side.

The owlbear roared in pain.

Gale laid his hands on Sui, helping him to his feet. His hands glowed, sealing the shoulder gash and the stomache wound.

“Thanks.” Sui drew an arrow and unloaded into the owl bear.

The owlbear roared again, but this time, it sounded more like a cry for help. Four roars replied.

Gale turned to the sound. In the dark rainy night, four round shapes approached along the river. Lightning flash. Four bears snarled, their eyes angry.

Gale jumped. “This one advises getting out of here!”

“You stay off my friend!” Gra didn’t hear Gale as he battled the owl bear.

Gale ran up and tagged Gra in the stomache. “These ones should get going!”

Gra swung his axe, nearly hitting Gale. “I don’t advise touching me right now.” When he turned, he noticed the four bears approaching. “Oh shit.”

The bears had gotten close enough that they were basically surrounded.

“Sorry, Gale, it looks like we have to fight this one out.” Gra tightened his grip on his battleaxe’s now slippery wet handle.

“This on will fight to dead!” Gale yelled. But then his tone became fearful. “But hopes he has not to.”

Sui gulped, feet shaking. He missed two arrows aimed at the bears. “I can’t see shit!”

“Yeah now would be a good time to turn on your darkvision.”

The bears took off in a sprint at the party, charging the party.

A flash of light, but no thunder. Suddenly the muddy water around the bear’s feet hardened up their legs. The bears tripped on their faces. The mud turned into ice, freezing them in place. A flash of lightning revealed the source: a deer with sparking antlers just on the other side of the stream.

“*Astalir*!” Gra gasped to himself. “Sui! Gale! Focus on the owlbear!” Gra roared, landing a hefty blow onto the owl bear.

Gale slashed its legs with his scimitar, slowing it down.

Sui shot at it with his bow, but kept missing. “Screw it!” He dropped his bow and pulled out his shortsword. “RAAHHH!” He charged forward, until he felt a beak and fur. He plunged his sword into the beast’s flesh, wherever he could find it. He punctured a major artery and it started bleeding.

Gra kept an eye on the bears. They struggled to break free of the ice, but being as strong as they are, it didn’t take them long. Two bears broke free and swam against the stream to get to the other side. One broke free and charged the party, heading straight for Gale.

Gra gave the owlbear one last slash before lunging forward to punch the charging bear in the face. Bone cracking assured Gra he had shortened the bear’s snout.

It stumbled back, but didn’t dawdle. It got on two feet and came down onto Gra’s shoulder, biting deep into his shoulder.

“RROOOOOAAAAAHH!” Gra roared in rage. His muscles bulged, the veins on his head popped, and his eyes filled with red. He swung his axe wildly at the bear. “ROH! ROH! ROOOH!”

The bear bled with each slice. It fell down, trying to get up.

One of the bears that crossed the river came back across it, choking, but making great time. It rammed its frozen friend, breaking it free from the ice. The two bears roared as they approached, igniting the fire in the wounded bear’s eyes.

It got up and slashed Gra in the shoulder. The two other bears charged up from behind it and grabbed each of his hands in between their teeth.

Gra’s grip failed him and he dropped his axe.

“This one holds your candle!” Gale thrust his yinglet hand forward at Gra, streaming golden light onto his back. That light flowed over Gra, presenting itself as holy golden armor plates.

“ROOOHH!” Grar yelled. He clenched his fists, grabbing the tongues of each bear. He twisted and pulled the tongues, forcing the bears to move at his discretion. He crashed them right into each other. Water droplets sprayed up, creating a mist.

The bears let go of his hands, stunned on the ground for a moment. The third bear reared up and slashed at him, but its attack just glanced off the golden armor on his chest.

“ROOOH!” Gra picked up his battleaxe. He lifted it up and swung it into the bear’s skull, splitting it in two.

“Bleat! Bleeeat!” A painful cry came from across the river.

Gra turned to look. Astalir was being cornered by the fourth bear. A splash of water hit the bear, swallowing itself into the bear’s mouth.

The bear choked and gagged, but made one last swipe at Astalir, knocking him into the river. The river iced up around where Astalir fell.

“Astalir!” Gra yelled. The red drained from his eyes as fear and worry filled his thoughts.

Meanwhile, the two bears got up from the ground. They lept onto Gra while he was distracted, knocking him to the ground. The golden light armor protected him from a few attacks, but the bears broke through it.

Gra was taking blow after blow. His chest looked like it had gone through a meat slicer, and his hands were mangled meat twigs.

“Graaaa!” A voice raged from behind a tree. With a slam and pound, the bear miraculously rose off the ground.

The bear screeched and clawed at the air, but was unable to hit Gra. One by one, its limbs clung to its body, becoming completely immobilized.

Gra got out from under the bear, seeing a familiar face standing next it. It was none other than… *himself*! “Thanks, Gra!”

“You’re welcome, Gra!” His clean, uninjured face smiled back at him.

The bear roared.

“Oh shut up!” New Gra snapped. He looked at the bear aggressively, and it started choking, its esophagus visibly collapsing.

Gra swung his axe through the air, killing it instantly.

A roar replied from across the river. Gra turned to look. The fourth bear slashed the ice structure in the river, and then swam across.

Out of the ice structure floated a hump with a bunch of sticks attached to it. Gra gasped. It wasn’t moving, not even a little.

“Astaliiiir!” Gra ran to the river, jumped in, and grabbed the hump of flesh. It was deer in form, complete with a set of antlers. Gra grabbed it in his arms, ignoring the pain from the multiple lacerations on his arms. He refused to let his broken fingers let go. Gra brought the hump of flesh onto land, and gently laid it down. “Come on, Astalir, come on.”

Gra put a hand on the lump of flesh. It was cold, like an ice cube. Its chest was torn open, ribs poking out. Its legs were mangled and frost-covered. The hump didn’t show any signs of motion, save for a faint heartbeat. It got slower and slower.

Gra’s heart beat rapidly in his chest. “Astalir, come on Astalir. What do you need? Um, you’re cold! Your cold.” Gra picked him up, letting his own broken index finger snap backwards. He hugged him close. The lump’s head leaned up against his. Its cold, dead eyes stared into his own desperate eyes. He stared into them. “Show me a sign you’re alive!” But there was no magic in those eyes. “Help!”

Gale rushed over. “Is that one dead?”

“No! No! No! Help!” Gra laid the lump down so Gale could lay his hands on it.

Gale did so, but his hands flickered out when he lit them up. “This one is out.”

“Suuii!”

“Would an acid potion help?” He poured one onto his leg, and it healed instantly.

“Is this deer your friend?” New Gra approached.

“YES!”

“I will help.” New Gra stood next to the lump, and it lifted into the air. The frost fell off and the lump melted. Its neck, once frozen stiff, now let the head lean to one side. The torso contracted and convulsed. The lump gagged and water spewed from its mouth.

The deer’s lungs moved the chest in and out in a rapid cycle. Its breathing was rapid and frantic.

New Gra looked at Gra’s open arms, and the deer floated down into them. “It’s stable, but it needs medical attention ASAP.”

Gra reached for his cloak to peel off a patch. His broken fingers wouldn’t cooperate. “Gra, this one!”

New Gra nodded and ripped off the patch in question. It was a maroon patch in the shape of a potion bottle. As it leapt off the cloak, it expanded into a round potion bottle with a red bubbling liquid. New Gra held it firmly in his hand as he flicked off the cork and poured the contents down the throat of the deer.

The deer blinked. It looked around.

“Astalir?” Gra whispered to it.

Astalir looked at him, eyes wide.

“Deer? You ok?” New Gra asked.

Astalir looked at New Gra, and then back at Gra. He squirmed in Gra’s arms, rolling out onto the ground, landing on all fours. He jumped left, and he jumped right. Two deer landed in the mud a few feet from Gra and ran away, limping heavily.

Gra waved to both of them with his messed up hands. “Bye!”

“Will it be ok?” New Gra asked, getting ready to chase one.

Gra motioned to stop. “It’s fine. Let him go. He can take care of himself from here.”

Gale groaned.

Gra stood up. “Oh right! Party check! Is everyone alright?”

Sui joined up. “I’m fine, but…” He turned an empty vial upside down. “I’m all out of acid.”

“You do acid?” New Gra asked.

“Well, yes… but you don’t have to phrase it like that.”

“This one is injured, needs rest.”

“Let me see.” Gra inspected the wound. “Looks like a night of rest should fix that right up.”

“Is there a tavern near here?” New Gra looked around.

“This way.” Gra led.

Gra, Sui, Gale, and New Gra journeyed through the rain and dark to the tavern. They tended to their wounds. Gra got his fingers bandaged up until Gale could have a good rest. They got some food and ale, had some fun getting the edge off after a stressful encounter, and then headed to bed. Gra paid for the rooms.

After everyone had gone to bed, Gra walked out to the tavern porch. He let the rain pelt him as he stepped in the light puddles. He looked at the staircase. There was no old man there asking for loose change, just an empty spot of dirt.

Gra leaned on the porch railing and called out, “BLEeeeEEAAAaaaT!”

He listened, but there was no reply. No friendly bleat, no mocking laughter, no approaching deer friend.

Astalir was supposed to meet them there at the tavern that night, but he was nowhere to be found.

Gra sighed. “I hope you’re alright out there, wherever you are.”

# Chapter 7 – The Cat’s Coat

On the side of the road this fine summer’s day, a little old shopkeeper, who was most definitely your average shopkeeper, set up shop along the side of the road. His wagon of supplies was parked and blocked, his display table was set up, and his most lucrative items were on full display. Now all he needed was some guinea pigs—uh, customers. He needed customers.

The first one of the day made a grand entrance: a blue swirling smoke sphere grew into a portal between some trees, and out stepped a humanoid silhouette. In a brilliant flash of light, the portal vanished. A black-furred tabaxi with green eyes, wearing a hood, approached the shopkeeper’s stand.

“Welcome to Don JeLancie’s Department of Joy. What can I do for you today?” The shopkeeper motioned to his display items.

“What do you have in winter clothing?” The tabaxi looked over the items.

“Going someplace cold, I see? How about this winter coat bundle? It includes everything you need: gloves, pants, boots, the works.”

“This is exactly what I need…”

“And?”

“But it’s not magical. Do you have any magical coats?”

“I don’t *have* any, but I can make one. What do you need it to do?”

“I want it to go in the air.”

“An airborne winter coat?” Don JeLancie laughed.

“Why? Is it ridiculous?”

“Yes.” Don JeLancie settled down. “Which is just my style.” He took the coat back, holding it from the collar. “Who do I have the pleasure of enchanting this chaotic item for?”

“Drathalion Treescorn, the famous interplanar traveler.”

“The *famous* interplanar traveler? How have I never heard of you?”

Drathalion shrugged. “I try to keep to myself.”

“Uh-huh. I’ll be right back.” Don took the coat into his wagon and shut the door behind him. Drathalion perked an ear to listen in. A hint of light squeaked through the seems in the door. Then Don emerged with the coat. “Here you go, one enchanted coat that lets you go in the air.”

Drathalion grabbed an edge and felt it. She could feel magic running through it. “Thank you.”

“That’ll be 500 gold.”

“Five… hundred?”

“Yes.”

Drathalion took out her coin purse, counting her coins. “How’s 200 sound?”

“Like not enough.” Don took the coat back. “Come back when you have the coin.”

“Hold that item for me. When Drathalion, the great interplanar explorer returns, she’ll want that.”

“Very well. You have 24 hours before I sell it.”

Drathalion nodded and walked down the path.

When her back was turned, Don snapped his fingers, and a fly appeared from a bright flash. The fly was tiny, but upon close inspection, one could make out Don’s face on the fly’s head. Don flicked the fly, hitting Drathalion on the shoulder. The fly was so light she didn’t feel it.

Don snapped his fingers again, causing a pair of fly-eyed goggles to appear on his face. Inside, he could see out of the fly’s human face.

“Let’s see who this “interplanar” visitor is, hmm?”

He watched as Drathalion walked down the path for an hour or so to the nearest town, where she came upon a tavern. She seemed to know her way around the town, as if she had been there before. The tavern was empty on the front, but there were several people inside. Drathalion entered. The dining room was full of people eating breakfast.

“What are we waiting for?”

“The deer.”

Drathalion’s ear pricked. A pale green half-orc sat a table with 3 other members, one of whom was another pale green half-orc.

“Who is this deer anyway?” The second half-orc asked.

The first half-orc sighed. “He’s a friend.”

“So where is he?” A yellow dragonborn took an angry sip from his mug.

“I’ve been calling for him, but since what happened last night, he hasn’t answered any of my calls.” The first half-orc said.

“We can wait for him for a little while longer, see if he shows.” The second half-orc said.

“I can’t believe he’s been keeping us waiting this long.” The dragonborn grumbled.

Drathalion pulled her hood further over her face. She sat on a bar stool at the counter.

“How can I help you?” The dwarf behind the counter asked.

“I’ll have a berry… omelet.” Drathalion leaned in.

The dwarf looked puzzled. “We don’t have that.”

“It’s a flat food, golden brown, with blueberries.”

“Pancake.” The half-orc came to the bar.

“Yes, blueberry pancakes.” Drathalion tossed some coins on the counter.

“I’ll get you a full stack. And you sir?” The dwarf turned to the half-orc.

“Just a question. Have you seen the old man today?”

“That beggar on the front porch? Thankfully, not today.”

“Ok, thanks.” The half-orc returned to his table.

Soon, the dwarf brought out the pancakes, and Drathalion ate them.

Then the tavern doors burst open, and an exasperated bird person hobbled in. It spoke in tweets and caws, seemingly at the whole tavern. It looked around, its eyes landing on the party with the half-orc. It squeaked and cawed frantically, as if it was trying to tell them something, waving a letter around, written in a foreign script.

“Anyone know what this guy is saying?” The half-orc asked.

“No, Gra, I don’t.” The second half-orc shrugged.

“I’m sorry, we don’t understand.” Gra tried to shoo the bird person away.

Drathalion’s eyes lit up. She approached the table. “I have flown a great distance to deliver this letter.” She held a hand to her perked ear.

The party turned to her and listened. The bird person cheered and continued its message.

“I need to find one named Revali. He should be in the aarakocra village of Wind’s Crossing. I need to deliver this letter to him.”

The aarakocra squawked and smiled at Gra, holding out the letter.

“Will you take this to him? I’ll give you 200 gold.” Drathalion changed tone. “Oh! Negotiate for 300!”

Gra held up 3 fingers. “3 gold?”

The aarkocra eagerly nodded, and held up 3 feathers. He pulled out a pouch and cawed.

“Does this look right?”

Gra held the coin pouch in his hand, tossing it in the air. The coins came down with a satisfying *clink-clink*. “Yeah this should do.” He nodded and shook the aarakocra’s feathered hand.

He tweeted.

“Thank you. Happy flights!”

The aarakocra left.

“Thanks for translating.” Gra addressed Drathalion. “That was very helpful.”

Drathalion bowed. “My pleasure.”

“Where we’re going, we’re going to need a translator. Mind tagging along?”

“I’d be delighted to.”

Gra stuck his hand out to shake.

Drathalion hesitated, but then offered her right hand too. When it came out of the sleeve, the cast was clearly visible. It covered her palm and stretched up to her elbow.

Gra shook it carefully. “What happened to you?”

Drathalion shrugged. “Got in a fight. You should’ve seen the other creature.”

“What did you do?”

“I’m an archer, like Sui here. I shot it in the face, and it died. Put simply.”

“Well it sounds like I can count on you in a fight, I like that.” Gra emptied the gold onto the table and split it into 5 piles, one for each party member, including Drathalion.

Each one grabbed their share of gold, but Drathalion’s share slid to her across the table, falling off the ledge into her bag below.

Gra also handed the letter to the other pale-green half-orc. “Keep this safe.”

“Of course, Gra.”

The party introduced themselves: Gra the half-orc, Sui the dragonborn, Gale the Yinglet, and Gra the half-orc (the second one).

“Before we get going,” Drathalion warned. “We have to stop and get some winter clothing. There’s a shop along the way, I’ll show you. Do you have the map?”

“How do you know I have a map?” Gra took it out.

“I assumed the aarakocra gave you one?”

Gra eyed her. “I have it.” He placed it on the table.

Drathalion took out a pen and marked a dot on the map. “It’s here. Let’s go.” She stood up.

Gra pushed her back into her seat. “No we have to wait for the deer.”

Drathalion looked to the side, then pointed out the window. “What’s that old man doing out there?”

“Old man?” Gra turned. He got out of his chair and went out to the porch, looking for the old man.

The old man in shaggy clothes with a tin can was in his usual spot, but this time he was dancing like a mad man.

“Astalir, it’s good to see you.”

The old man turned to Gra, gave a thumbs up, then ran around the side of the building.

Gra followed, but he didn’t find any trace of him. He sighed, leaning on his knees. “Back to your old tricks, huh?” He stood back up. “Ok, I’ll take that as the sign.”

Gra gathered the party members up, and they set off towards Wind’s Crossing.

“That was most informative.” Don JeLancie rubbed his hands together, still looking through the fly-eyed goggles. “They’ll be here soon. This’ll be quite fun.” He chuckled to himself.

“Um, hello?”

Don lifted his fly-eyed goggles. A customer stood before him.

He was wearing green sleeves and leggings, a brown vest, and a green hat with a feather.

“Ah, yes, how can I help you?”

“My grandma is getting really old, and we fear for her health.”

“Ah, I have just the thing!” Don reached under the counter and pulled out a health potion. “One moment please.” Don entered his wagon and shut the door behind him. He held the potion in one hand and snapped his fingers with the other. A brilliant flash of light appeared for a brief moment, and when it was gone, the potion sparkled and was extra bubbly. Don emerged from his wagon and presented the potion to the customer. “This potion is what you need, mister…?”

“Robin Hood.”

“Mr. Robin Hood. This is the potion you need.”

“What does it do?”

“Just have her drink this and she’ll get better in no time.”

“Thank you!” Robin Hood took the potion.

But Don held it back. “That’ll be 1700 gold.”

“Oh, of course.” Robin Hood pulled a bag from his belt and tossed it on the counter. “That should be enough.”

Don counted real quick. “My, my. There’s only 1500 gold here.”

“Will you accept 1500 gold?”

“Hmm…” Don thought. “No. The price is still 1725 gold.”

“You just increased the price!”

“No, the price has always been 17*50* gold.” Don smugly smiled.

Robin Hood became cross. “I see what you’re doing, and I don’t like it. But I’ll get you that 1750 gold.” He stormed off.

“Hagglers.” Don muttered as he put his fly-eyed goggles back on and leaned back in his chair. Drathalion and her party were still on their way to his shop.

==================

It wasn’t long before they arrived.

“Greetings! Welcome to Don JeLancie’s Department of Joy. What can I do for you?”

Gra looked over the items displayed on the counter. “Do you have any winter attire?”

“That I do, my friend.” Don pulled a winter coat out from under the counter. “This will keep you warm even in the coldest of places. It comes with gloves, leggings, and hat included.”

“That’s great!” Gra took the coat, inspecting it. “We’ll take 5.”

“Ok, that’ll be 100 gold.”

“100 gold each?!” Sui yelled. “Stop ripping us off!” Sui grabbed Don’s coat and attempted to lift him up.

A bell on Don’s chest rang. With a flash of light, Sui was shrunk down to the size of a coconut. Don caught him in his palm. “You shouldn’t have done that.”

=== THIS SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR REWRITING ===

“Put me down!”

“Not until you apologize.”

“Eh! Eh!” Sui loaded his bow and shot a tiny arrow at Don, which bounced uselessly off his clothes.

“Here, I got him.” Gra put his hands out, and Don dropped Sui into his hands. “Sorry for my associate’s aggressive behaviour.”

“Not a problem, as long as you keep him in check.”

“So, about those coats, 90 gold for all 5?”

“The price is still 125 for all 5.”

“But you said it was 100 before.”

“No, I always said it was 150 for all 5.”

Gra stared at him, dismayed. “I’ve got a feeling you’re not being honest with me.”

“Look, can you just lower the price back to 100 gold?” Other Gra butted in.

“No, I will not lower the price below 175.”

Other Gra stood next to the counter, and Don’s jacket scrunched up and he floated into the air. “Look, we just want the jackets. Don’t punish us for our dragonborn’s mistake. We don’t listen to him anyways.”

Don felt around his stomache. His hands couldn’t quite touch his ribs. “Ooh! This is interesting. But yes, you have a point. I will give you a 75 gold discount.”

“That’s not what I—”

Gra laid his hand on Other Gra, cutting him off. “That’s very gracious of you, thank you.”

Other Gra relaxed and Don floated back to the ground.

“I’m glad we could settle that. But, you still broke the rules.” The bell rang and a light flashed. “Perhaps you will learn to keep your hands off me.”

“Are you ok?” Gra asked Other Gra.

Other Gra rubbed his stomach and drooled from his mouth. “Bagels.”

Drathalion took advantage of the commotion. Eying a particular coat with bubbly features, she snatched it.

“Nuh uh uh.” Don’s bell rang and a light flashed.

Drathalion dropped the bubble coat on the ground. Her fingers hung in a neutral position. She stared at them. “I can’t feel my hands!”

“Well that’s what you get for trying to steal.”

She tried moving her fingers, but they only twitched.

Gra settled down. “I’m sorry for my associate.” He eyed Drathalion. “But can we continue with the purchase?”

“Yes. Let’s.”

“Let get out my 100 gold.” Gra rummaged around in his bag of holding.

Tiny Sui peeked in. “You got the deck of random oddities in there?”

Other Gra caught Sui. “Are you a bagel?”

“No! Put me down!” Sui protested.

“Ok, so you said 100 gold *total* for the 5 coats?” Gra counted out the gold.

“Yes, that is correct.”

Gra and Don exchanged gold for coats. Gra went to hand each member a coat, but found it difficult to. One was too small to hold it, one was a tiger, and one was too busy craving bagels to think about coats. Except Dog Drathalion: she had gotten over her sudden transformation and was thinking.

“Coat?” Gra handed it to her.

“Thanks.” Dog Drathalion accepted it. “Can I borrow 200 gold?”

“What? No. I barely know you.”

“Well I am your guide and translator, consider it a prepayment for my services.”

“Well we don’t need a guide. I have this map.” Gra pulled it out of his bag. “Besides, what do you need 200 gold for?”

“There’s this item I want to buy. With it, I’ll be able to keep us safe.”

“Ok, what does it do?”

“It lets me fly.”

“Just you? How about us?”

“Well, no, just me. But if I can fly, I can carry you one person at a time anywhere.”

“Hmm… no.”

“It’ll be very useful for protection.”

“I don’t think we’ll need to worry about that. We have a secret weapon.” Gra crossed his arms.

“Secret weapon?” Dog Drathalion cocked her head.

“Yes, whenever we get in trouble, something comes in and keeps us safe.”

“Would this secret weapon happen to be a dear friend of yours?”

“Deer friend? No, no one said anything about a deer.”

Dog Drathalion squinted. “I’ve heard rumors that this friend of yours had a very bad accident and is out of commission.”

“How would you know?” Gra stared into Dog Drathalion’s eyes. If this was one of Astalir’s illusions, he would know it. But no, Dog Drathalion did not fade or go transparent. “Huh?” Gra stewed. He looked away.

“Ok, how about 50 gold?”

“50 gold? Ok.” Gra gave it to Dog Drathalion.

“Thank you.”

“Gra?” Other Gra was worried.

“Yes, Gra?”

“Don’t look now, but there’s a tiger right beside us.”

“Oh, don’t worry about him, he’s a party member.”

“We have a tiger in our party?”

“Yes.”

“Does he have bagels?”

“This one, unfortunately does not.” Tiger Gale responded.

“He speaks!” Other Gra exclaimed.

“Yes, he is a speaking tiger.” Gra confirmed.

“What is his name?”

“This one’s name is Gale.”

“Gale? I think I know a kangaroo named Gale.”

“Yinglet, but yes.” Tiger Gale corrected.

“Wow, what a coincidence! You’ve got to meet my friend Gale, Gale. I think you two would get along famously.”

“This one would be delighted.”

“Gale?”

“Yes?”

“Do you have any bagels?”

“This one does not, but would like some.”

“I’ve got bagels!” Dog Drathalion pulled some bagels out of her coat. She held one out to Other Gra.

“Yay!” Other Gra grabbed at it, but Dog Drathalion swiped it away.

“50 gold.” She waved it in his face.

“Uh!” Other Gra whined. “I want it, but 50 gold? That’s a bit steep, don’t you think?”

“Stop ripping us off!” Sui yelled helplessly from Other Gra’s palm.

“Shush, shush.” Other Gra put a finger over Sui’s mouth. “Here’s 50 gold.”

“Thank you.” Dog Drathalion gave the bagel to Other Gra.

“What is this? It’s got blue dots all in inside it.”

“Those are blueberries. They’re blueberry bagels.”

“Blueberries, huh? How do they taste?”

“Like… blue?”

“Ok.” Other Gra took a bite. He looked disgusted. “This… doesn’t taste… like bagels.”

“It’s a new flavor. A bit experimental.” Dog Drathalion encouraged. “Just keep chewing, it’ll get better.”

“If you say so.” Other Gra munched a bit more. “No, this definitely doesn’t taste like… wait! Pancakes?” Other Gra swallowed. “It tastes like pancakes!”

Dog Drathalion nodded. “Yes, it’s blueberry pancake flavor. It’s a new bagel flavor.”

“What a weird flavor.”

“Can this one try?” Tiger Gale opened his mouth.

“Sure. That’ll be 50 gold.”

“Ok.” Tiger Gale agreed.

Dog Drathalion pulled out another bagel and tossed it at Tiger Gale. She missed, and the bagel landed on Tiger Gale’s back.

“Oh. I can’t reach it.”

“I got it.” Gra went to grab the bagel, but stopped. Upon closer inspection, it interacted weirdly with Tiger Gale’s tiger fur. Fur was depressed where the bagel hole was supposed to be. He tried sticking his finger in the bagel hole, but felt something soft and squishy that definitely wasn’t tiger fur. He stared intently at it, and it faded away. Beneath the bagel was a blueberry pancake. “Odd.” He picked it up and plopped it into Tiger Gale’s mouth. “Here you go.”

“Thanks.” Tiger Gale munched it happily.

“No problem.” Gra rubbed Tiger Gale’s head. “Wow, your fur is so soft!”

“Let me try!” Other Gra rubbed Tiger Gale’s shoulders. “Wow, it is!”

Gra and Other Gra pet Tiger Gale all over: on the head, behind the ears, the shoulders, along the back, and on the chest.

“This one likes this.” Tiger Gale smiled as he leaned into the pets.

Dog Drathalion approached the counter. “I’ve got enough for the bubble coat now.” She placed the gold on the counter.

“Ah, but your attempt at a five-finger discount is going to cost you… um, 25 gold.

Dog Drathalion rolled her eyes, but put an extra 25 gold on the counter.

“Ah, yes, very nice.” Don collected the gold. “Here is your bubble coat, which lets you go in the air.”

“Thank you. How do I activate it?” Dog Drathalion took the coat.

“I think you’ll find it quite intuitive.”

“But—”

“Good day.” Don nodded at her, clearly trying to get her to go away. “It has been much fun watching you all react to your changes, but I hope you’ve learned your lesson?”

Gra nodded. “We will not attempt to aggress you again, Mr. JeLancie.”

“Very well. I accept your apology.”

“Now will you turn us back to normal?”

“No, but worry not. Your changes will automatically revert in 1 hour.” Don assured.

“Ok.” Gra motioned to the party. “Let’s go.”

“Would you like to rent a cart with horses? It’s a long travel.” Don held out an ad.

“No, we can walk.” Gra waved him off.

=== END REWRITING CONSTRUCTION ZONE ===

The party left. Gra led the way with his map, followed closely by Dog Drathalion. Other Gra held tiny Sui in one hand, and Tiger Gale’s furry shoulders in the other.

Don JeLancie looked on with a huge smile. He chuckled as he donned his fly-eyed goggles again. “That was quite fun. Indeed, this ‘Drathalion Treescorn’ is going to make one lovely guinea pig. Or maybe her companions would be more fun. We shall see…” Don snapped his fingers and he and his cart faded away, leaving an empty lot where it was once sitting.

The party ventured along the trail. Before the hour was up, they trekked into a deep dark forest. Crickets and birds chirped and trilled. Up ahead, Gra spotted a lone man wearing green clothes and hat.

“Hey, that’s Robin Hood!” Gra pointed him out.

“Is he dangerous?" Dog Drathalion asked.

“He steals from the rich and gives to the poor.”

“Rich? I just got 1000 gold from the cards last night.” Sui admitted. “Does that make me rich?”

“I don’t know.” Gra shrugged. “That’s for Robin Hood and his merry men to decide.”

“Merry men?” Dog Drathalion’s eyes darted around, looking for anyone hiding.

“Yeah,” Gra said. “Robin Hood’s band of guys who help he achieve his heists. Good people.”

“Are they here?” Dog Drathalion drew her bow.

“It’s ok.” Gra pointed her bow down. “We don’t want to fight. Don’s curses, remember?” Gra pinched his skin again, showing that it still bleeds.

“Right.” Dog Drathalion put her bow away.

The party approached Robin Hood.

“Hello, I am Robin Hood. And who might you be?”

Gra introduced the party to Robin Hood.

“You seem like good people.” He greeted. “Where are you headed?”

“We’re delivering a letter.”

“To where?”

“The mountains.” Gra waved the map.

“Ah, yes, those mountains. They’re right down this trail to the left. It’s not hard. But before you go, I have a favor to ask.”

Gra put the map away. “Yes?”

“Would you perhaps have any change to spare? I need help with a loved one who is sick.”

“How much do you need?” Gra asked.

“200 gold should be fine.” Robin Hood said.

“Ok, let me see.” Gra rummaged around in his bag of holding.

Dog Drathalion’s ears twitched. “I don’t like this.” She secretly picked up some rocks and put them in a bag. She held them to Robin Hood. “Here’s around 200 to 300 gold.” She opened the bag. Gold coins sparkled in the light that pierced through the treetops. “Gra, confirm?” She tossed the bag at Gra.

Gra tossed the bag in the air and let it land in his palm. “Feels like it weighs about… like it’s about 250 gold.” He pulled the drawstring shut and handed it to Robin Hood.

Robin Hood took it eagerly. “Thank you so much! This is going to help a lot. You may now pass.”

Dog Drathalion fake smiled and nodded.

The party walked passed.

Dog Drathalion whispered to Gra, “When we get out of range, run.”

Gra agreed. “Ok.”

When they got 90 feet away, Gra sprinted ahead. Dog Drathalion sprinted behind him, and the rest of the party followed suit. A mile later, they stopped.

“Why are we running?” Other Gra asked.

“Let’s just say that wasn’t a bag of gold.” Dog Drathalion answered.

“Rocks?”

“Yeah, how’d you know?”

“…Lucky guess.”

The party ventured onward, and eventually reverted back to normal. Sui returned to normal size, but still had to wrestle himself out of Other Gra’s grip. Other Gra no longer craved bagels, and Gra’s skin returned to normal.

Dog Drathalion noticed the changes reverting and ran into the forest alone. She cowered in her cloak as she transformed back into her old self. Her hood stretched up to over twice her head size, her tail shortened, and her voice changed. Then with a flickering spark, she returned to her normal self. She emerged from the woods once again a cat.

Oh, and Tiger Gale transformed back into yinglet Gale.

“This one still wants pets though.”

“Of course!” Other Gra scritched him behind the ears.

The party ventured onward. They ventured mostly uneventfully through the forest. Along the way, Drathalion spotted a rabbit. She blinked and a blue paw print appeared on the rabbit. She drew her bow and shot at it. She missed and the rabbit ran off, taking the blue glowing pawprint with it, until it was out of range.

When they got a few miles from the mountains, they came across a shop on the side of the road. It was run by a lizardfolk and served mostly fresh meats. “What can I get for you today?”

“Do you have any clams?” Gale asked.

“Yes I do.” The lizardfolk said.

“You should get that checked out.” Other Gra retorted.

“No, you’re thinking of crabs.” Gra corrected.

“This one will have *clams*. Just the clams.”

“Here you go.” The lizardfolk gave Gale a bowl of clams.

Other Gra stepped to the counter. “I would like some bagels. And they better not be pancakes.”

“Why would they be pancakes?” The lizardfolk asked quizzically.

“I got ripped off last time.”

“Ok, would you like it toasted or buttered?”

“Both.”

The lizardfolk made a bagel for Other Gra and handed it to him.

“And what about for you?” The lizardfolk asked Gra.

“I’ll have…” Gra looked directly at Drathalion. “Venison.”

Drathalion scowled.

“Oh! Me too!” Other Gra chimed in.

Drathalion grumbled and pulled her hood over her face.

“Would you also like venison?” The lizardfolk asked Drathalion.

Drathalion put a hand over her mouth like she was trying to keep from puking. She turned around and ran to the other side of the path. There, she stepped on a strange twig and a hole opened up beneath her. She twisted around and managed to grab the edge of the pit. Gra casually walked over to check on her.

The lizardfolk listened in on their conversation.

“What’s wrong, Drathalion?” Gra grabbed her good hand and pulled her out of the pit.

She dusted herself off at the top of the pit.

“Do you not like venison? Or is there some other reason…” Gra got right up in her face. “…Astalir?”

Drathalion panicked and waved her arms in front of her. “It’s not me! It’s not me!”

Gra gave a slight nod. “Ok, I’m with you. Drathalion.”

Drathalion calmed down. “Thank you.”

The lizardfolk gave the party some food, and then the party left. As they walked away, the lizardfolk food wagon faded away.

=============

And then Don JeLancie’s Department of Joy faded in. And he already had a customer.

“I got the 1700 gold!” Robin Hood exclaimed, pouring coins out of bags on the counter. So far so good, a huge pile of gold. Then he poured out the last bag. A bunch of rocks came tumbling out. “What?”

“Nice try,” smirked Don. “But I don’t accept merrymen currency.”

“Merrymen? No, this was supposed to be gold. I got it from that dog person with the pet tiger.”

“Ah, the dog person, yes.” Don chuckled.

“I can’t believe they tricked me like this! Even after knowing I needed it to help my sick grandma!”

Don smiled evilly. “You must be so upset.”

“Indeed I am!” Robin Hood kicked a rock.

“Well, it’s also unfortunate that you tried to offer me counterfeit change, which is against the rules.”

“What are you going to do?”

“A test.” Don’s bell rang and a flash of light struck Robin Hood.

“AAARGGH!” Robin Hood’s silhouette grew twice as large as his legs and torso stretched to the sky.

“How delightful!” Don exclaimed at his new creation. “Now, Robin Hood, you have about an hour to enact your revenge.” Don reached under the table and produced a compass. “Oh! And here is something to help you find them.” He handed the compass to Robin Hood. It had a picture of Drathalion behind the needle. “Have fun!”

Robin Hood stomped off down the path.

===========

Hours later, the party found a nice place next to a river. Gra started a campfire and Other Gra started a conversation.

“These people are trustworthy, right?” Other Gra whispered to Gra.

“Yeah, I think so.”

“None play tricks on us?”

“Well…” Gra poked the fire. “None more than usual, and none maliciously.”

“Good enough for me.” Other Gra turned to Gale. “Hey Gale, what would you do if you saw a mythical creature?”

“It would be delightful, maybe.” Gale sat next to Other Gra, petitioning him for pets. “This one holds no grudge against any creature.”

“You have grudges?”

“This one only wishes to kill the undead.”

“Understandable.” Other Gra stroked Gale’s head and shoulders. “What about you, cat?”

“Me?” Drathalion leaned up against a tree. “I would run away.”

“What? Are you a scaredy cat?”

“I mean… run away to get in optimal shooting range. I am a ranger, after all.”

“I see…”

Gra pushed a twig back into the fire. “I would befriend it.” He looked at Drathalion. He groaned.

“You ok?” Drathalion asked.

“Yeah, I just got a splitting headache. Something probably took the chance and got through my skin when it was thin.”

“Well you know the one way to stop it, right?” Other Gra continued petting Gale.

“What’s that?”

“Step on a sharp rock. That way you feel the pain of the rock more than your headache.”

“Good one.”

“Speaking of which, I have to go.”

“And find a sharp rock?”

“Yeah, so I can piss on it.”

“Ah, I gotcha.” Gra let Other Gra go.

Other Gra went deeper into the forest, out of sight of the party.

Gale scooched up next to Gra, asking for pets. As Gra obliged, Gale smiled.

“Want to draw a card?” Gra asked.

“Sure.” Gale drew one, and a top hat appeared on his head. “This one feels fancy.”

“Wow, that’s a nice hat.”

“Thanks! More pets?”

“Sorry, I can’t pet your head when there’s a hat on it.”

“This one laments getting hat.”

Out of the bushes, something came through. It wasn’t Other Gra, but a little girl.

“Who is that one?” Gale pointed.

“Her? She’s been with us this entire time.” Gra stated.

“I don’t remember them.” Drathalion looked puzzled.

“They’ve been, here, this entire, time.” Gra winked at her.

“Oh!” Drathalion’s eyes lit up. “Right! Yes, they *have* been here this whole time!”

Gra nodded.

Gale stared at her. “What?”

“Can you remind me your name?” Drathalion asked.

“You forgot already?” The girl asked.

“My memory is bad.”

“This one confuse. This one Gra?”

“No I’m Gra.”

“But she Gra, too.”

“No, she’s Reesu.”

“What?” Gale was getting flustered. “Come pet this one now. This one will find truth instantly.”

Reesu sat next to Gale. Her hands didn’t move, but Gale’s fur bent and swayed like he was being petted.

“Ah yes! She pet like Gra. This one Gra. No no Reesu, two Gras.”

Gra crossed his arms. “She was with us at the battle with the owlbear.”

“No, this one remembers two gras.” Gale gave in to the pets. “Ok, ok. As long as you give good pets, this one no question.”

“Maybe you’ll remember me tomorrow.” Reesu pet Gale as his eyes got heavy.

“Sleep on it.” Gra agreed.

“This one will go to sleep, yes, and then….” Gale fell asleep, head resting in Reesu’s lap.

Drathalion sat next to Reesu and whispered to her. “How do you do that?”

“It’s easy,” Reesu explained. “Just pet him very gently and he’ll go right to sleep.”

“No, not that. How do you change your voice?”

Reesu laughed. “I can’t change my voice.”

Drathalion stared at her. “Hmm… ok. Do you know who I am?”

“You’re a cat.”

“Yes, good.” Drathalion motioned to Gra. “I need a word with you.” She led him to a tree that blocked the party’s sight of her.

Gra accompanied her.

Drathalion disappeared, and underneath, a deer took her place. The deer got down on all fours, then lifted its front right leg up. It had a cast on it that had been wrapped by a friend who had affectionately written “\<3 Jodi”. The deer breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you.”

“Astalir!” Gra whispered. He petted the top of his head. “You’re speaking with me, that’s new, and very welcome. How are you holding up?”

“Healing is slow, it’s scarred.” He pumped his casted leg. “Can I see the map?”

Gra took it out and it floated over to Astalir. A pen floated out of his fur and they both pinned against a tree. The pen drew an angry face in the forest where they encountered Robin Hood. Then the pen flew back to Astalir, and the map floated back into Gra’s hand.

“You don’t want to run into Robin Hood again?” Gra lightly chuckled.

“I don’t think he’d be pleased to run into us again either.”

“Speaking of sharing the wealth, here’s your cut.” Gra handed him a bag with 200 gold. “This is for the kobold quest.”

“Thanks, but I didn’t actually help you with it.”

Gra shrugged. “Eh, ok, think of it as a thank you for saving our butts from the bears.” Gra sat down against the tree.

Astalir laughed. “Ok, that works. By the way, here’s your 50 gold back.” Astalir floated 50 gold into Gra’s hands as he laid down next to Gra. He rested his head against the corner where Gra and the tree met.

“Thanks.”

“Hey, Gra?”

“Yeah?”

“I can’t… I can’t…”

“It’s ok, Astalir, you can trust me.”

“I can’t sleep.”

“Why not?”

“If I go to sleep, I lose my disguise. I don’t trust the party to know I’m Astalir.”

“I’m sure it’ll be ok…”

“I don’t trust them.”

“Ok, it’s ok, Astalir.” Gra patted him on the head. “I’ll stand guard for you, make sure they don’t see you.”

“Thank you.”

“I can’t sleep either.”

“Paranoia too?”

“Just got a cup of coffee with that keeps me up.”

“Must’ve been one strong cup.”

“Yeah, it was.” Gra patted his back. “You go on to sleep now. I’ll keep you safe.”

“Thanks, Gra.”

“Sleep well, buddy.”

Don JeLancie clasped his hands enthusiastically. He was still viewing Astalir through the fly-eyed goggles. “Oh ho ho! This’ll be quite entertaining! I can’t wait for Robin Hood to get there!”

# Chapter 8 – Robin Hood

=== 2023-06-03 ===

=== this chapter under construction ===

=== please wait for the official announcement of completion ===

“I can’t believe they gave me fake change!” Robin Hood stomped along the path towards Drathalion’s location. His merry men followed closely behind him. “I’m going to make them pay! In gold, this time!”

Robin Hood’s unusually long, slender legs gave him the impression of using stilts. But no, this was Don’s doing. Robin Hood had to make good use of this while he could, although he wasn’t comfortable fighting in this state.

“My knees feel way too vulnerable.”

Finally they caught up to Drathalion and her party. They were making camp and talking to each other. Robin Hood stood behind a large tree and observed the camp from his tall height, waiting for an opportune time to strike.

Drathalion the cat talked with a pale green half-orc alone by a tree. Even in the dark, Robin Hood could see them with his temporary dark vision eyes, which also gave him 20/20 vision, even at this far range.

The cat turned into a deer, which was a surprise, but not enough to deter Robin Hood. The half-orc gave Drathalion a bag of gold, and this bag looked to be full of actual gold.

“Perfect! That’s just what I need.” He reached down and tapped Marigold the assassin on the head. “Go.”

Marigold the assassin sneaked through the bushes until she was in pouncing range of the half-orc. With a coordinated effort from some fellow bandits, she jumped out of the bush and held a knife to the half-orc’s neck. Another bandit held a fully charge arrow shot to the deer’s face.

“Give us the gold, and no one gets hurt.” Marigold snarled. “And don’t you even think about yelling for help.” She pressed the knife a little harder up against his neck.

“Sure, let me get that for you.” The half-orc slowly reached into his bag of holding. “I know I have it in here somewhere.

The deer didn’t say anything, but dumped his backpack on the ground. All sorts of items came pouring out, but a bag of gold was not one of them.

Meanwhile, Robin Hood was directing his other bandits to surround the entire party. A dwarf bandit snuck up on the tiny kangaroo, who was sleeping on a rock. Several bandits set up behind trees, bows aimed at the dragonborn. Several more archers took aim at the half-orc and deer.

The pale-orc took his sweet time producing the gold as his eyes dart left and right, assessing the situation. “Oh! Here it is! Here you GO!” The pale-orc drew out a battle axe from his bag of holding and swiped at Marigold.

Marigold’s armor protected her from the attack, but she staggered backward into the bush.

The other bandits all fired, starting confrontations all over the camp.

The archer shot the deer in the face, but the arrow slowed down considerably, only getting stuck in the deer’s nose. The deer then transformed back into the cat and climbed the tree, knifing a bandit or two that tried to grab it as it went up. The cat pointed at a bandit, and a blue pawprint appeared on his chest. The cat landed an arrow in the bandit, hitting it right on the pawprint. The bandit fell over, dead, and the pawprint moved to a new target.

Bandits surrounded the half-orc, who swung his axe in a circle, beheading two bandits in one swing. The cat shot a bandit in the back, and the half-orc plowed his blade into his chest.

The dragonborn took one shot to the back, but seemed unphased. The bandits swarmed him with daggers. So he reached into a pocket and pulled out a potion of green liquid.

“That’s not what I think it is?” Robin Hood’s mouth dropped.

The dragonborn took a swig of the green liquid and then splashed the bottle on the ground, which shattered and splashed its contents everywhere.

The bandits cried in pain as their clothes, skin, and flesh dissolved before their eyes, which also dissolved. The dragonborn, on the other hand, was completely unscathed, and in fact, seemed to have healed all the arrow wounds.

“He must be an acid dragon.” Robin Hood commented to himself. “We’ll have to outrange him.”

The archer bandits shot arrows at him, several of them hitting. One hit him in the neck.

The dragonborn didn’t fall. He removed the arrow from his neck, put it in his dragonbow, and then took aim at two of the archers who shot him. “Wanna try that again?” He let the arrow loose, and it whizzed by the closer archer, slicing his ear in half. That archer and the one next to him dropped their bows and ran off.

“That guy’s tough. We’re going to need more man power to take him down.” Robin Hood turned his attention to the sleeping kangaroo. “Ah, this should be easy!”

The kangaroo slept on a rock near the river bank. He lay in a rather awakward-looking position. A sneaky bandit snuck up on him as he slept. The bandit drew his dagger and plunged it into the kang—

The kangaroo rolled over in his sleep, just as the bandit was stabbing him, causing the dagger to get stuck in the rock.

The bandit kept his cool, and got his bow out instead. From point-blank range, he shot the kang—

He missed. The arrow went right over the kangaroo’s head, and into campfire, where it promptly burned up.

“He’s asleep! How did you miss??”

A small woman crossed the river behind the bandit. She tapped him on the shoulder, and then as soon as he turned around, she let out a shockwave and disappeared. That shockwave disintegrated the bandit, splashing his blood all over the kangaroo and his rock. The small woman ended up right behind Marigold.

Marigold was battling the half-orc. True to her skill, she was dodging battle axe swings and cat arrows, using her armor as a useful defensive tool.

“At least one of my group is competent.”

Marigold took advantage of the half-orc’s openings and plunged her poison-tipped dagger into his shoulder, his belly, and his ribs. He was tough, but little by little, she was wearing him down.

“Just like she wore me down, haha.” Robin Hood chuckled.
