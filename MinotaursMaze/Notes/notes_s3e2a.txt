Minotaurs Maze
S3E2a

=====
(i got here late)

bob climbed a wall

sui shot him

bob hid behind wall

sui flew up and shot him anyway, crits, kills bob


=====


notes from centaurus:
bob climbed on the pillar, sui shot at him twice, bob jumped down, moved, lit a tree on ðŸ”¥ and sui shot at him, making him go unconscious

okay ðŸ™‚ also right before the match started, KT went over to Sui, grabbed his arm and said something in his native Draconic Tongue, basically saying good luck out there, the Shadar Kai is hard to take down, hope you win
