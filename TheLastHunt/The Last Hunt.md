# The Last Hunt

# Chapter 0 – Prologue: Seeker, Tabaxi Artificer

Donovard Erstwald climbed to the top of the hill and planted his wooden staff at the top, leaning on it as he scanned the forest. Lush bushes, vibrant flowers, and strong trees populated the rolling hills welcoming him forward.

He looked back at his wife, who was struggling up the hill. “Need some help?” He held out his hand.

“Thank you.” Emigail Sweetpaw grabbed his human hand in her tabaxi paw, and pulled herself up. She too planted her walking stick on the top of the hill.

“What do you think of this hill top?” Donovard leaned down and rubbed Emigail’s round belly.

“Ugh…” Emigail exhaled. “It’s a bit too steep. Plus it’s not close enough to Albaridge.”

“Ok, we’ll find another hill. How are you holding up?”

“Ugh…” She leaned up against him, tail curling around his legs. “I’m glad you’re carrying the equipment.”

“Hmm.” He smiled, caressing her head, and giving her a kiss on her furry head between her ears. “How about a less permanent encampment? Just for the night?”

“I could use some time off my feet.” Emigail took her bag off and sat down on a rock, holding her belly as she plopped down.

“I’ll start the campfire.” Donovard kissed her forehead. “Rest up, now, sweetie.”

Donovard gathered and chopped the wood, and got a campfire going in no time. He cooked sausages for them both. They talked the afternoon away into the evening.

“You know,” Emigail snuggled up to Donovard. “This hill isn’t so bad. It’s got a nice view of the hills, nice shade. And the flowers. They’re so pretty. They remind me of home.”

After a few hours, they passed out slumped up against the rock, caressing each other in their arms. The fire crackled, keeping all of them warm: Donovard, Emigail, and their future children. Bunnies bounced around all night, nurturing themselves on the crumbs they left behind.

=======

It was another few weeks until they got to Albaridge. After settling down in the inn, they ventured out into the town in search of a healer. They were directed to Elder Elminac.

“So…” The old man clung onto his staff for dear life, shaking uncontrollably as he laid his hand on Emigail’s belly. “You’ve come to me… for a… blessing? Of fertility…”

“Yes, Elder.” Emigail bowed.

“Human and Tabaxi… quite rare…” He took a step towards his hut. “But I’ve handled… stranger… Come…” He led them, over the course of a few minutes, into his hut.

“Thank you so much.” Donovard helped Emigail find a seat inside the hut: a turned-over hay pail. He knelt down next to her. “We’ll find a way to pay you back.”

“Nonsense…” Elder Elminac waved his hand flippantly as he flipped through a spell book on his desk. “This’ll be easy…” He stroked his beard. “…or impossible.”

Emigail held Donovard’s hand tightly, squeezing in sweaty anticipation. Donovard had his head pressed into her bossom. Both her watching the elder as he took his sweet old time flipping through the book one page at a time.

Finally, he spoke. “Ah, yes. Polymorph. So… which one… will it be?”

They looked at each other, confused.

“I’m sorry?”

“Do you…” He pointed at Donovard. “Want to be a… Tabaxi…” He pointed at Emigai. “Or do you… want to… be a human?”

“We’ve… never thought about this before.” They exchanged glances.

He nuzzled his face under her chin. “I love your pretty kitty face.” He whispered.

“And I love your smooth silky skin.” She rubbed his shoulder, passing her paw under his sleeve.

“I don’t want you to change.”

“You’re perfect, just the way you are.”

Elder Elminac exhaled. “That was the… easy option…”

“What’s the hard option?”

“I can polymorph… your children… when they’re… born.”

Emigail lowered her head, holding back tears. She failed, and they streamed down her face, parting her fur along her muzzle.

Donovard fetched her a handkerchief. To the elder, he gave a downtrodden look. “We’ve had five miscar—attempts. We’ve traveled all over the land.”

“I see…”

“Is there anything you can do?”

“This is a fertility clinic… and I am bound… by oath… and by will… to help you…” He took out a piece of parchment. He took out a pen. He started writing. “But for this… problem… I require… assistance.” He gave them a name and location for a sorcerer renowned for his custom spells. “Go… Talk to…”

There was a knock at the door.

“Thank you, Elder Elminac.” Donovard helped Emigail to her feet.

As they left, another couple walked in, round belly and all.

“What are we going to do?”

“This sorcerer is too far away. We won’t make it there before you—”

“Ahh! Ahh!” Emigail wailed. She laid down on the inn bed, legs spread.

“Is it happening?”

“It’s too early! It’s too early!”

“Maybe it’s stressed induced? Try to calm down. Take a deeeep breath. Think of that hill. All the beautiful flowers. Think of home.”

“Uh-huh.” Emigail sobbed. “They were pretty.”

“Think of their scent, the wind blowing through, and the leaves fluttering to the ground.”

Emigail inhaled. “Yes, that is quite lovely.” She breathed in again, and calmed down. “Thank you.” She shut her eyes.

“It’s all going to be fine.” Donovard laid on the bed next to her. “We’ll get to that sorcerer, don’t you worry.”

=======

On the way to the sorcerer, they crossed over that same hill again.

“Well, what do you know?” Donovard chuckled. “Do you want to stay another night here?”

Emigail smiled. “Sure.”

They camped there for the night.

During the night, Emigail woke up in a cold sweat. “Donovard! Wake up!”

“Huh? What?”

She shook him. “Wake up!”

Donovard sat up, washing out his sleepiness with adrenaline. “What’s wrong?”

“Something’s out there.”

Donovard held still. “I don’t hear it.”

“It’s over there.”

“Ok, I’ll go investigate.” He lit his lantern with the campfire. “You stay here.”

Emigail took one look around. The campfire made it difficult for her cat eyes to adjust to the darkness of the night. She grabbed his hand before he could get away. “No.”

“Emigail…”

“I’m coming with you.” She pulled herself up and clung to her arm.

“What does it sound like?”

“Like a cry.”

“I still don’t hear it.”

“I’ll guide you. Just… support me.”

He wrapped his arm around her, weaving his hand under her armpit. “I got you.”

Emigail led him around several hills, stopping several times to catch her breath. She walked so fast when they were moving she was tiring herself out. Finally they came to a cave. Despite the moon, the inside of the cave was a complete mystery.

Emigail freed her hands and moved her palms around each other. A small speck of light formed between them, and then vanished. She almost fainted.

“Hey now, the doctor in Excoport said no spells.”

“But he didn’t say anything…” Emigail blew on her clawed finger, and her finger glowed a dim white. “…about cantrips.” She smiled proudly.

“Ok as long as you stay awake, I’ll allow it.”

They hobbled into the cave. A high-pitched squeal could very easily be heard from inside.

“That sounds like…”

“A child in need of help.” Emigail pointed the way.

In the cave, they found a little pile of fur piled in the corner, shivering. A small, orange glow came from inside its fur. When they approached, it lifted its head. It had a huge black nose, spherical eyes on either side of its long head, and large fluffy pointy ears sticking out to its left and right. It was a baby deer!

“It’s a fawn!” Emigail exclaimed. She reached an unsteady hand out to it, finger aglow.

The fawn sniffed her finger. “BLEAT!” It squealed.

“Did you bring some food?” Emigail opened her hand.

“I got some sesame seeds.” He handed her the bag.

She held them out, and the fawn ate from her hand. “You’re hungry, little one.”

“And cold.” Donovard stroked its fur. He picked up the glowing orange stone. “Wow, this is warm to the touch. What’s it doing here?”

The fawn kicked the stone out of his hand and pressed into it with its hoof. The stone glowed even brighter, and even hotter. “Bleat!”

“Do you want to come home with us?”

“Emigail, its mother could come back any minute.”

“Well we can’t leave him here. He’s cold and alone.”

“Ok. I’ll get the gear.”

Donovard brought their equipment into the cave. They cooked over the glowing orange stone, and snuggled close against the cave wall. The fawn curled up in their lap. They stroked its fur as they dozed off to sleep.

=======

“Seeker! Seeker!” Emigail yelled out of the door to her house. “Get back here!”

A deer-shaped humanoid ran on two legs back to the house. “Yes, mother?”

“You forgot your helmet.” Emigail slid a yellow helmet with two strips removed onto the deer’s head, around his antlers. Then she attached a strap around the front to secure. For good measure, she rocked it back and forth. It was sturdy. “You excited for your first day in the mine?”

“Yeah! Father’s going to show me how to use a pick axe!”

Emigail laughed. “Yeah he will. Ok, you’re all set. Stay safe, my fawn.” She gave him a hug.

“Of course Mother. Bye!” Seeker ran off down the path around the winding hills and into a cave. Even in the middle of the day, the cave swallowed all light. That’s why there were gem stone fragments lining the walls, glowing along the path to the current vein. Seeker followed them all the way to his father.

“Seeker, is that you?” Donovard set down his pickaxe.

“Yes father it’s me!”

“Ah there’s my boy!” He knocked on Seeker’s helmet. “Look at you, all geared up and ready to mine!”

“I got my own pick-axe too!” Seeker held up a deer antler that had been carved into a sharpened point.

“So you do!” Donovard picked it up and compared it to his own. “It looks just like mine.” He handed it back.

“Ok! I’m ready!”

“Ready? But you haven’t done your stretches yet!” Donovard tickled him in the belly. “Silly buck. Now here’s what you do.” Donovard led him in a series of stretches designed to prevent injury on the job.

Seeker followed intently, but was not very good at doing them.

“Ok, now that we’ve stretched, here’s how you use a pickaxe—”

“Arrgh!” Seeker picked up his pickaxe overhead and charged the wall. He swung with all his might, hitting the wall with full force. The antler pickaxe bounced off the wall. “Did I get it?”

Donovard stifled his laughter. “That was a good first try. However, mining, like many things, requires lots of time and patience.”

Donovard gave Seeker a lecture, and then it was time for lunch. Seeker ran home to bring back lunch.

But while he was out among the rolling hills, he noticed something shiny in the tree tops. It had a silver surface that reflected the sunlight. Standing back, Seeker could see more of it. It had a small body, short limbs, a long pointy thing, and a head with a single red eye.

The single red eye stared back, shining a bright red “light” into Seeker’s face.

Seeker looked away. “Bleat?”

“Seeker!” Emigail ran to him. “Seeker!” She punched the air in front of her with her palm towards Seeker.

“Mother?”

*BANG!*

In an instant, Seeker was on the ground, bleeding out.

“Target downed. Proceed with collection procedures.” The silver sentry in the tree beeped.

Three bugbears fell out of the same tree. They approached, arms raised.

Emigail growled, spitting saliva at them. She inhaled, and let out a terrifying roar. “GET AWAY FROM MY SON!”

“Knock out obstacle. Acquire target.” The robot ordered.

The bugbears lept into the valley, grabbing onto Seeker’s legs.

But Emigail was fast. She curled her fist into a tight grip, and tree roots lept up from their feeding to ensnare the bugbear, pulling it to the ground before it could lay a claw on the little deer. She blew air into her hand, forming an icycle, which she then threw at another bugbear, pinning its claws to a nearby boulder. She stared at the third bugbear intently. “Picking on a child? You’re despicable.”

The bugbear stopped in its tracks. Its expression went from menacing to concerned, to guilty. It hung its head and walked away.

The other bugbears were busy freeing themselves.

Emigail rushed to Seeker’s side. “Seeker, are you ok?”

“Mother…” He closed his eyes. His arms went limp.

“Don’t worry, my fawn,” She picked him up. “Everything’s going to be ok.” She stretched her two legs, casting energy through them. With him in her arms, she ran as fast as she could back home.

The bugbears managed to free themselves, but by the time they did, she was already home. They followed her there, and knocked on the door.

Emigail willed her energy into the door, keeping it from bursting open.

From behind, a bugbears got hit with something fierce. Fiery arrows cracked through its skull, downing it in several hits. Its burning body slumped over and rolled down the porch.

The surviving bugbear turned around.

A cross middle-aged human held his bow and arrow straight at it. He shot it several times, but this bugbear blocked them all with its arm.

The embedded arrows did nothing to slow the bugbear down. It charged at Donovard and knocked him back.

Donovard’s lungs flattened as he hit the side of a stone wall. He recovered quickly. He kissed the gemstone on his sloppily-made necklace and pulled out his dagger.

The bugbear slashed at him again, but the cuts weren’t as deep. It was as if Donovard had super thick skin. The bugbear opened its mouth wide to bite.

Donovard slipped his dagger in its mouth, end-to-end, holding its jaw open.

The bugbear tried closing its mouth, but couldn’t.

Donovard took an arrow and plunged it into its heart. He blinked, and all of a sudden he was on the porch.

Without Donovard fighting back against its pressure, the bugbear fell over, forcing the arrow deep into its chest. The bugbear bled out on the floor.

Donovard went inside. “Emigail. Seeker. Everyone ok?”

“Seeker’s badly wounded, but I sealed the wound.” Emigail laid over him, hands glowing.

Donovard caressed his son in his arms. “You’re so brave. You’re so brave.” He kissed him on the forehead.

Seeker woke up. “What happened?”

“Bad people tried to kill you. They’re gone now.”

=======

“No, ma’am. We don’t know.” The sheriff of a nearby village said.

“Are you sure that no one has ever seen a tiny little tree golem hunting with three bugbears?”

“Ma’am, if I hadn’t seen the two bugbears, I wouldn’t have believed you.” The sheriff spat in the grass. “C’mon, a tin can working with the most dangerous animal in the wild? Preposterous.”

“Well, can you check your records anyway?”

“Sure, I’ll humor you. Gibsi! Do we have any reports of a golem and bugbears?”

Gibsi walked in and handed the sheriff several scrolls.

“Well, I’ll be.” The sheriff’s eyebrows raised involuntarily. “It seems such a thing was sighted in other parts of the kingdom. None here in Albaridge though.”

Emigail took the reports. “Hunted deer… seen carrying carcass… antlers sticking out of bag…”

“They seem to be wildlife hunters. Must’ve confused your kid for game.”

“I know what I saw. That wasn’t a hunting trip.”

“Suit yourself, but we have no way of going after them.”

“Can you stop them from returning?”

“No one saw them come in, no one saw them leave. What do you think?”

Emigail looked at Donovard. “We could use another human in the house.”

Donovard shook his head. “We’ll do what we can.” He hugged Emigail. “Another tabaxi would be just fine.”

“Ok, we’ll let Seeker decide.” Emigail hugged him back.

=======

“How does it feel?” Emigail stood behind Seeker as he looked in the mirror.

“Weird, but cool.” Seeker admired his new cuff. It was a thin of steel wrapped around his wrist. In the side were several etchings filled in with black tree sap, and sealed over with finisher. He held it up to the mirror to see the symbols on the other side. Beyond the cuff, his face stared back at him. His whiskers bounced off his cheek puffs, his tiny pink nose, and green slit-pupil cat eyes. His ears were triangle shaped, lining up with his patch of white fur that formed a “mask” on his otherwise black-furred head. His body was all black, save for his white-socked hands and feet, and white belly. “I always wanted to be more like you, mom.”

Emigail chuckled. “And why’s that.”

“You protect people, and scare away the bad guys.”

“Mmhmm, and maybe I’ll scare you away too, if you don’t keep yourself clean.” She licked the top of his head. “Finally I can get to the top of your head.”

“Mooooommm!” He ducked out of her affectioned licking. “I can do it myself.”

“I know. I just wanted to do it one last time.” She hugged him from behind.

Donovard walked in, all dirty from a day in the mines. “Wow, you look good, buck.”

“Excuse me, father!” Seeker held his chin up. “For I am a tomcat now.”

“And a handsome one at that.”
